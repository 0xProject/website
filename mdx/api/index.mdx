# Introduction

**The 0x API is the liquidity and data endpoint for DeFi**. It lets you access aggregated liquidity from tens of on-chain and off-chain decentralized exchange networks, across multiple blockchains. It comes with many parameters to customize your requests for your application and your users.

While the 0x Labs Team hosts a version of the 0x API (subject to the [0x Terms of Service](https://0x.org/terms)), all the code is open source and available at the [0x-API GitHub repo](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-api).
If you run into a problem, don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-api/issues).

We offer hosted versions for different Ethereum networks. Requests for more networks, and questions/feedback in general should be directed at our [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/d3FTX3M).

| Network             | Endpoint                      |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Mainnet             | https://api.0x.org/           |
| Binance Smart Chain | https://bsc.api.0x.org/       |
| Ropsten             | https://ropsten.api.0x.org/   |
| Polygon             | https://polygon.api.0x.org/   |
| Avalanche           | https://avalanche.api.0x.org/ |
| Fantom              | https://fantom.api.0x.org/    |
| Celo                | https://celo.api.0x.org/      |

## Versioning

Each 0x HTTP API `path` is versioned independently using URI versioning. The format is: `https://api.0x.org/<path>/<version>/<endpoint>`.

For example, you can request `https://api.0x.org/swap/v1/quote` which represents `v1` of the `quote` endpoint in the `swap` path.
URLs not adhering to this format are not supported.

A major version bump occurs whenever a backwards incompatible change occurs to an `endpoint`, in which case every `endpoint` in that `path` will be on the next version.
Old versions of the API will be deprecated and new features will be rolled out to them on a best-effort basis.

## Pagination

Requests that return potentially large collections are paginated and respond to the `page` and `perPage` parameters. For example:

<HttpCall path="/sra/v4/orders?page=3&perPage=20" />

Any endpoint that follows this convention will display the following:

<Notification type="alert">This endpoint is paginated.</Notification>

And will only document the objects in the `records` field.

### Request

| Query Param | Description                                                                                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `page`      | (Optional, defaults to "1") The page index (1-indexed) requested in the collection.           |
| `perPage`   | (Optional, defaults to "20") The amount of records to return per page. The maximum is "1000". |

### Response

| Field     | Description                                                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `page`    | The page index (1-indexed) of returned in the response (same as request if provided). |
| `perPage` | The amount of `records` requested in the pagination, but not necessarily returned.    |
| `total`   | The total amount of `records` in the collection (accross all pages).                  |
| `records` | The actual `records` returned for this page of the collection.                        |

If a query provides an unreasonable (ie. too high) `perPage` value, the response can return a validation error as specified in the [errors section](#errors).
If the query specifies a `page` that does not exist (ie. there are not enough `records`), the response will return an empty `records` array.

## Errors

Unless the spec defines otherwise, errors to bad requests should respond with HTTP 4xx or status codes.

## Common Objects

This section outlines API JSON objects that are common to many endpoints.

### Signed Order

A [0x Limit Order](https://protocol.0x.org/en/latest/basics/orders.html#limit-orders) with additional fields and ready to be consumed by our tooling and sent to the [0x exchange proxy contract](https://protocol.0x.org/en/latest/architecture/proxy.html).

| `sender`              | An advanced field that doesn't need to be set. It allows the maker to enforce that the order flow through some additional logic before it can be filled (e.g., a KYC whitelist) -- more on the ability to extend 0x later. |
| `verifyingContract`   | Address of the contract where the transaction should be sent, usually this is the [0x exchange proxy contract](https://protocol.0x.org/en/latest/architecture/proxy.html).                                                 |
| `chainId`             | The ID of the Ethereum chain where the `verifyingContract` is located.                                                                                                                                                     |
| `signature`           | A JSON object with the signature of the fields above using the private key of `maker`. The fields of the signature object are documented in the table below.                                                               |

#### Signature

A structured object containing the signature data for the order. For more info see [How to sign](https://protocol.0x.org/en/latest/basics/orders.html#how-to-sign).

| Field           | Description                                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `signatureType` | A number representing the signature method used for signing the order, EIP712 (2) and EthSign (3) are supported. |

| `v`             | An integer number with signature data.                                                                           |

## Misc.

-   All requests and responses should be of "application/json" content type.
-   All token amounts are sent in amounts of the smallest level of precision (base units). (e.g if a token has 18 decimal places, selling 1 unit of the token would show up as selling "1000000000000000000" base units by this API).
-   All addresses are sent as lower-case (non-checksummed) Ethereum addresses with the `0x` prefix.
-   All parameters should use **lowerCamelCase**.

# Swap

This API faciliates consuming the best-priced liquidity from the greater DEX ecosystem, including tens of on-chain and off-chain liquidity networks.
We use smart order routing to split up your transaction across decentralized exchange networks to be filled with the lowest slippage possible while minimizing transaction costs.
Follow the "[Swap Tokens with 0x API](/docs/guides/swap-tokens-with-0x-api)" guide to see how to use it.

## GET /swap/v1/quote

Get an easy-to-consume quote for buying or selling any token.
The return format is a valid unsigned Ethereum transaction and can be submitted directly to an Ethereum node to complete the swap.
For transactions where the `sellToken` is not ETH, you will have to [set your allowances](/docs/guides/how-to-set-your-token-allowances).

### Request

Either a `sellAmount` or `buyAmount` is required.

| Query Param             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

If the validation fails a Revert Error will be returned in the response.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `excludedSources`       | (Optional) Liquidity sources (`Uniswap`, `SushiSwap`, `0x`, `Curve` etc) that will not be included in the provided quote. Ex: `excludedSources=Uniswap,SushiSwap,Curve`. See [here](https://github.com/0xProject/protocol/blob/4f32f3174f25858644eae4c3de59c3a6717a757c/packages/asset-swapper/src/utils/market_operation_utils/types.ts#L38) for a full list of sources                                     |
| `includedSources`       | (Optional) For now only supports `RFQT`, which should be used when the integrator only wants RFQT liquidity without any other DEX orders. Requires a particular agreement with the 0x integrations team. This parameter cannot be combined with `excludedSources`.                                                                                                                                           |
| `skipValidation`        | (Optional) Normally, whenever a `takerAddress` is provided, the API will validate the quote for the user. (For more details, see ["How does `takerAddress` help with catching issues?"](/docs/guides/0x-api-faq#how-does-takeraddress-help-with-catching-issues).) When this parameter is set to `true`, that validation will be skipped. See also [here](/docs/guides/rfqt-in-the-0x-api#quote-validation). |
| `intentOnFilling`       | (Optional) Used to enable RFQ-T liquidity. For more details see the guide [Understanding RFQ-T and the 0x API](/docs/guides/rfqt-in-the-0x-api).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `feeRecipient`          | (Optional) The ETH address that should receive affiliate fees specified with `buyTokenPercentageFee`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `buyTokenPercentageFee` | (Optional) The percentage (between 0 - 1.0) of the buyAmount that should be attributed to `feeRecipient` as affiliate fees. Note that this requires that the `feeRecipient` parameter is also specified in the request.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `affiliateAddress`      | (Optional) An ETH address for which to attribute the trade for tracking and analytics purposes. Note `affiliateAddress` is only for tracking trades and has no impact on affiliate fees, for affiliate fees use `feeRecipient`.                                                                                                                                                                              |

### Response

| Field                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `price`              | If `buyAmount` was specified in the request it provides the price of `buyToken` in `sellToken` and vice versa. This price does not include the `slippage` provided in the request above, and therefore represents the best possible price.                                                                                       |
| `guaranteedPrice`    | The price which must be met or else the entire transaction will revert. This price is influenced by the `slippagePercentage` parameter. On-chain sources may encounter price movements from quote to settlement.                                                                                                                 |
| `to`                 | The address of the contract to send call `data` to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `data`               | The call data required to be sent to the `to` contract address.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `value`              | The amount of ether (in wei) that should be sent with the transaction. (Assuming protocolFee is paid in ether).                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `gasPrice`           | The gas price (in wei) that should be used to send the transaction. The transaction needs to be sent with this `gasPrice` or lower for the transaction to be successful.                                                                                                                                                         |
| `gas`                | The estimated gas limit that should be used to send the transaction to guarantee settlement. While a computed estimate is returned in all responses, an accurate estimate will only be returned if a `takerAddress` is included in the request.                                                                                  |
| `estimatedGas`       | The estimate for the amount of gas that will actually be used in the transaction. Always less than `gas`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `protocolFee`        | The maximum amount of ether that will be paid towards the protocol fee (in wei), and what is used to compute the `value` field of the transaction.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `minimumProtocolFee` | The minimum amount of ether that will be paid towards the protocol fee (in wei) during the transaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `buyAmount`          | The amount of `buyToken` (in `buyToken` units) that would be bought in this swap. Certain on-chain sources do not allow specifying `buyAmount`, when using `buyAmount` these sources are excluded.                                                                                                                               |
| `sellAmount`         | The amount of `sellToken` (in `sellToken` units) that would be sold in this swap. Specifying `sellAmount` is the recommended way to interact with 0xAPI as it covers all on-chain sources.                                                                                                                                       |
| `sources`            | The percentage distribution of `buyAmount` or `sellAmount` split between each liquidity source. Ex: `[{ name: '0x', proportion: "0.8" }, { name: 'Kyber', proportion: "0.2"}, ...]`                                                                                                                                              |
| `buyTokenAddress`    | The ERC20 token address of the token you want to receive in quote.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `sellTokenAddress`   | The ERC20 token address of the token you want to sell with quote.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `allowanceTarget`    | The target contract address for which the user needs to have an allowance in order to be able to complete the swap. For swaps with "ETH" as `sellToken`, wrapping "ETH" to "WETH" or unwrapping "WETH" to "ETH" no allowance is needed, a null address of `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` is then returned instead. |

If the [`eth_call`](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_call) fails (because `takerAddress` cannot complete the transaction), the response will include reasons for the failure.

#### Wrapping and unwrapping between ETH and WETH

Easily wrap and unwrap between ETH and WETH by requesting a swap quote by setting `sellToken` and 'buyToken' as either 'WETH' or 'ETH'. The swap quote returned will provide the calldata to directly interact with the `WETH9` contract and not with 0x exchange contracts.

#### Ensure RFQ-T liquidity

RFQ-T liquidity can only be accessed if the request supplies a taker address, a permissioned API key via header `0x-api-key`, and the query parameter `intentOnFilling=true`. For more details see the guide [Understanding RFQ-T and the 0x API](/docs/guides/rfqt-in-the-0x-api).

## GET /swap/v1/prices

`Deprecated`. Get the amount of `sellToken` to purchase one unit (not base unit, one unit adjusted by number of decimals for asset) for tokens supported by `/swap/v1/*` endpoints.
If a token is not returned, it may still be available but not queryable by token symbol.

### Request

| Query Param | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sellToken` | (Optional, defaults to "WETH") The ERC20 token address or symbol of the token you want to get the price of tokens in. "ETH" can be provided as a valid `sellToken`. |

### Response

Response will be an array of token symbols and the respective price in `sellToken` for one buy unit.

| Field    | Description                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `symbol` | The symbol representing the Ethereum token. |
| `price`  | The price of `symbol` in `sellToken`.       |

## GET /swap/v1/price

Nearly identical to [`/swap/v1/quote`](#get-swapv1quote), but with a few key differences. Rather than returning a transaction that can be submitted to an Ethereum node, this resource simply indicates the pricing that would be available for an analogous call to `/swap/v1/quote`. Intended for use with RFQ-T; see [Quote Types: Indicative vs Firm](/docs/guides/rfqt-in-the-0x-api#quote-types-indicative-vs-firm) for more details.

### Request

Identical to the request schema for `/swap/v1/quote`, with one exception: the `skipValidation` parameter - 
* On Mainnet, `skipValidation` is always considered `true`, even when a `takerAddress` has been specified. Note that this will change soon to behave as it does on Ropsten. 
* On Ropsten, `skipValidation` behaves identically to that on `/swap/v1/quote`. For details, see the `skipValidation` parameter in the [/swap/v1/quote Request](https://0x.org/docs/api#request-1) section.


### Response

## Websocket API

The Standard Relayer API also exposes a websocket server at the root endpoint.

| Network | Endpoint                      |
| ------- | ----------------------------- |
| Mainnet | wss://api.0x.org/orderbook/v1 |

The server will allow you to subscribe to 0x order updates,
and will push updates whenever the "fillability" of an order changes.
In practice, this will happen whenever a new order is added, an order is cancelled, or an order is filled.
At the moment, the update message will not specify the exact reason for the update.

All messages (both request, and response) adhere to the format below:

| Field       | Description                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `requestId` | A string uuid that will be sent back by the server in response messages so the client can appropriately respond when multiple subscriptions are made. |
| `payload`   | (Optional) A JSON object documented below, that contains the body of the message.                                                                     |
