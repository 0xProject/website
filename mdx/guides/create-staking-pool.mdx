# How to setup and manage a ZRX staking pool

0x v3 introduces a staking system that allows market makers to grant ownership over the protocol while receiving monetary rewards based on their share of liquidity provided, and the share of ZRX tokens staked in their pools.
For more information about the rationale behind the stake-based liquidity incentives, refer to [the first proposal](https://blog.0xproject.com/0x-roadmap-2019-part-4-proposal-for-stake-based-liquidity-incentive-52c16558df29) and the [v3 vote blog post](https://blog.0xproject.com/0x-the-community-owned-liquidity-api-26da5732447e).

_This guide is meant to assist existing and prospective market makers in setting up their staking pools._

## What is a staking pool?

For each 0x trade, the buyer (also known as a taker) pays a small protocol fee denominated in Ether that is calculated as a multiple of the trade’s gas price. The fees are routed into the Staking Pool owned by the maker of the specific order, provided that the address has been registered as a pool operator or as a market maker address by the operator.

Fees are accumulated in staking pools over the course of a 10 day interval (known as an epoch). At the end of each period, the Liquidity Rewards are automatically distributed to the pool operators based on their trade activity and the amount of ZRX staked over the epoch. Any rewards that were not distributed (due to liquidity providers not being fully staked) will automatically roll over to the next epoch, bootstrapping the future Liquidity Rewards Pool for market makers.

<Notification type="alert">As a market maker, it's very important you create a staking pool and register all the address you use to create orders to avoid losing the liquidity rewards you are eligible for.</Notification>

The creation of a staking pool is completely anonymous, as the only information needed are the addresses providing liquidity. Optionally, you will be able to add simple metadata to your staking pool that will be stored in a publicly available github repo that will power the ZRX Portal.


## What do I need to get started?

In order to get started, you need the following information:

* **a unique address set as the pool operator**. This does not need necessarily need to be the primary address you use to create 0x orders as a maker. This address is the one you will use to manage the staking pool.
* (optional) **other addresses you are using to create 0x orders as a maker**.
* **an initial amount of ZRX** . You can later add more ZRX, or widthdraw them. Other ZRX token holders can decide to stake with your pool, if they find an incentive (see next point). The minimum amount required to route protocol fees into the pool is 100 ZRX at any time (see [here](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-protocol-specification/blob/3.0/staking/staking-specification.md#801-logic-of-payprotocolfee)).
* **your operator share**. This value represents the percentage of rewards that the pool operator is willing to share with its delegators. The value can be set between 100 (the total rewards are assigned to the pool operator) to 0 (all rewards are assigned to delegators). A market maker can decide to decrease the operator share value to attract delegators to stake more ZRX tokens with them. Once a staking pool is created, it is possible to only decrease this value.

If you are interested in adding metadata to your staking pool (name, bio, website, logo), we have created an [open registry](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-staking-pool-registry) to do that.

## How do I create and manage a staking pool?

It really is just a matter of sending transactions to the staking contract. Depending
The code examples listed below can be found in the [0x starter project](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-starter-project/tree/3.0) repo, where you can find the 0x TS tooling implementation.


### Create a staking pool

Relevant function: [createStakingPool](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-protocol-specification/blob/3.0/staking/staking-specification.md#611-logic-of-createstakingpool)

This is a one-off transaction to create the pool. The caller of the function becomes the pool operator. This address does not need to be used for creating 0x orders.

<CodeTabs tabs={['Solidity', 'Typescript']}>

```js
/// @dev Create a new staking pool. The sender will be the operator of this pool.
/// Note that an operator must be payable.
/// @param operatorShare Portion of rewards owned by the operator, in ppm.
/// @param addOperatorAsMaker Adds operator to the created pool as a maker for convenience iff true.
/// @return poolId The unique pool id generated for this pool.
function createStakingPool(uint32 operatorShare, bool addOperatorAsMaker)
    external
    returns (bytes32 poolId);
```

```js
// Staking Proxy is a delegate contract. We initialize a Staking Contract (ABI) pointing to the delegate proxy
// at stakingProxyContractAddress
const stakingContract = new StakingContract(stakingProxyContractAddress, providerEngine, { from: maker });

const operatorShare = new BigNumber(900000); // 90%
const stakingPoolReceipt = await stakingContract.createStakingPool.awaitTransactionSuccessAsync(
    operatorShare,
    true,
    {
        from: maker,
    },
);
const createStakingPoolLog = stakingPoolReceipt.logs[0];
const poolId = (createStakingPoolLog as any).args.poolId;
```

</CodeTabs>

### Register additional addresses

Relevant function: [joinStakingPoolAsMaker](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-protocol-specification/blob/3.0/staking/staking-specification.md#615-logic-of-joinstakingpoolasmaker)
The transaction needs to be sent by the addresses you want to register into the pool. These are the addresses you will be utilizing to post orders as a makerAddress.

<CodeTabs tabs={['Solidity', 'Typescript']}>

```js
/// @dev Allows caller to join a staking pool as a maker.
/// @param poolId Unique id of pool.
function joinStakingPoolAsMaker(bytes32 poolId)
    public;
```

```js
await stakingContract.joinStakingPoolAsMaker.awaitTransactionSuccessAsync(poolId, { from: otherMaker });
```

</CodeTabs>

### Deposit stake

Relevant contract function: [stake](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-protocol-specification/blob/master/staking/staking-specification.md#501-logic-of-stake)

ZRX must be deposited into the StakingProxy contract before moving it into a pool. Before calling this function, the user must authorize the ERC20Proxy contract to transfer its tokens by calling zrxToken.approve.
<CodeTabs tabs={['Solidity', 'Typescript']}>

```js
/// @dev Stake ZRX tokens. Tokens are deposited into the ZRX Vault.
///      Unstake to retrieve the ZRX. Stake is in the 'undelegated' status.
/// @param amount of ZRX to stake.
function stake(uint256 amount)
    external;
```

```js
const stakingContract = new StakingContract(stakingProxyContractAddress, providerEngine, { from: maker });
const stakeAmount = Web3Wrapper.toBaseUnitAmount(new BigNumber(100), 18);
// Add stake to the staking contract, stored in the ZRX Vault
const stakeReceipt = await stakingContract.stake.awaitTransactionSuccessAsync(
    stakeAmount,
    { from: maker }
);
```

</CodeTabs>

### Stake ZRX with a pool

Relevant function: [moveStake](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-protocol-specification/blob/3.0/staking/staking-specification.md#521-logic-of-movestake)

This transaction is used to stake ZRX with a pool (after being deposited). Note that any ZRX staked to a pool by an address that is not an operator will be weighted at 90%. For this reason, the pool operator address should also be used to stake ZRX into it’s own pool. Note changes made from calling this function will only become effective in the next epoch.

<CodeTabs tabs={['Solidity', 'Typescript']}>

```js
/// @dev Moves stake between statuses: 'undelegated' or 'delegated'.
///      Delegated stake can also be moved between pools.
///      This change comes into effect next epoch.
/// @param from status to move stake out of.
/// @param to status to move stake into.
/// @param amount of stake to move.
function moveStake(
    IStructs.StakeInfo calldata from,
    IStructs.StakeInfo calldata to,
    uint256 amount
)
    external;
```

```js
const stakingContract = new StakingContract(stakingProxyContractAddress, providerEngine, { from: maker });
const poolId = '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001';
const stakeAmount = Web3Wrapper.toBaseUnitAmount(new BigNumber(100), 18);
// Add stake to the vault
const stakeReceipt = await stakingContract.stake.awaitTransactionSuccessAsync(stakeAmount, { from: maker });
// Move the staked ZRX to delegate the Staking Pool
const moveStakeReceipt = await stakingContract.moveStake.awaitTransactionSuccessAsync(
    { status: StakeStatus.Undelegated, poolId: NIL_POOL_ID }, // From undelegated
    { status: StakeStatus.Delegated, poolId }, // To the pool
    stakeAmount,
    { from: maker },
);
```

</CodeTabs>

### Unstake from a pool

Relevant contract function: [moveStake](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-protocol-specification/blob/3.0/staking/staking-specification.md#521-logic-of-movestake)

In case you need to reduce the amount of ZRX you have staked in your staking pool, you can do so by calling this function. Only the ZRX previously staked by the same address can be unstaked. This is another reason why we recommend  having the pool operator handling ZRX balances.

<CodeTabs tabs={['Solidity', 'Typescript']}>

```js
/// @dev Moves stake between statuses: 'undelegated' or 'delegated'.
///      Delegated stake can also be moved between pools.
///      This change comes into effect next epoch.
/// @param from status to move stake out of.
/// @param to status to move stake into.
/// @param amount of stake to move.
function moveStake(
    IStructs.StakeInfo calldata from,
    IStructs.StakeInfo calldata to,
    uint256 amount
)
    external;
```

```js
const stakingContract = new StakingContract(stakingProxyContractAddress, providerEngine, { from: maker });
const poolId = '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001';
const stakeAmount = Web3Wrapper.toBaseUnitAmount(new BigNumber(100), 18);
// Add stake to the vault
const stakeReceipt = await stakingContract.stake.awaitTransactionSuccessAsync(stakeAmount, { from: maker });
// Move the staked ZRX to delegate the Staking Pool
const moveStakeReceipt = await stakingContract.moveStake.awaitTransactionSuccessAsync(
    { status: StakeStatus.Delegated, poolId }, // from the pool
    { status: StakeStatus.Undelegated, poolId: NIL_POOL_ID }, // to the undelegated
    stakeAmount,
    { from: maker },
);
// Witdraw stake from the contracts
await stakingContract.unstake.awaitTransactionSuccessAsync(stakeAmount, { from: maker })
```

</CodeTabs>

### Widthdraw stake



### Decrease the operator share

Relevant contract function: [decreaseStakingPoolOperatorShare](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-protocol-specification/blob/3.0/staking/staking-specification.md#613-logic-of-decreasestakingpooloperatorshare)
To be successful, the transaction needs to be signed and sent by the pool operator address.

<CodeTabs tabs={['Solidity', 'Typescript']}>

```js
/// @dev Decreases the operator share for the given pool (i.e. increases pool rewards for members).
/// @param poolId Unique Id of pool.
/// @param newOperatorShare The newly decreased percentage of any rewards owned by the operator.
function decreaseStakingPoolOperatorShare(bytes32 poolId, uint32 newOperatorShare)
    external
```

```js
await stakingContract.decreaseStakingPoolOperatorShare.sendTransactionAsync(poolId, new BigNumber(1), {
    from: maker,
});
```

</CodeTabs>

## How do I choose the optimal parameters?

The system is designed to behave dynamically, based on your and other network players’ actions, so there’s no ‘one size fits all’ solution to maximize .

However, it is helpful to use this rule of thumb: the rewards per unit of ZRX staked are **maximized when your stake ratio is equal to 1**. The stake ratio is calculated dividing the relative share of ZRX staked (your ZRX staked divided by the total ZRX staked in the system) by your 'liquidity share' (the fees your orders have generated divided by the total fees generated by other staked market makers). When these two quantities are equal, your stake ratio is 1, and your rewards per unit of ZRX staked are maximized.
When your staking pool is under-staked (the relative share of ZRX is smaller than the liquidity share), your pool will not be allocated the entirety of the eligible fees. Increasing the balance of ZRX staked (by adding them yourself or incentivizing other token holders to delegate) will progressively maximize the liquidity rewards received.

When your staking pool is over-staked (the relative share of ZRX is smaller than the liquidity share), your pool will not be maximizing the rewards per unit of ZRX staked. Differently than the previous scenario, this is an allocation efficiency problem: your rewards will always increase the more ZRX are staked in your pool. By doing that, though, you will be decreasing the stake ratio of other staking pools whom might be incentivized in adding more ZRX stake or incentivizing other ZRX token holders to stake with them.

 For more comprehensive math, you can refer to [this section of the specs](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-protocol-specification/blob/3.0/staking/staking-specification.md#62-paying-liquidity-rewards-finalization) or [the original whitepaper](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-protocol-specification/blob/3.0/v3/protocol-fees.pdf).
