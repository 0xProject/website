This guide introduces the dashboards and tools available to explore 0x data, for different needs. In this piece, we are mainly focusing on ready-made analytics solutions that don‚Äôt require advanced data scraping. The following solutions are ideal for teams working on analytics product or data information sites, looking to integrate 0x data with minimum effort; or for DeFi researchers/analysts looking for ready made, reliable sources about the 0x ecosystem. At the end of the document we provide links to resources for advanced use cases.

## üó∫Ô∏è Scope and Concepts ‚úèÔ∏è

The following resources cover **active** versions of 0x exchange contracts (v2, v3, v4) and API endpoints (v1 `/swap`).
Based on the most common use cases, we will introduce how to get data on different layers of the 0x ecosystem, which are defined as follows:

### 1. The DEX Layer  - 0x Native

0x Native volume covers orders conforming to one of the 0x Native Order formats (currently two: Limit Order and Rfq Order) and are settled by 0x smart contracts. Orders generated from 0x open order book and RFQ system are settled on them. Besides that, as it‚Äôs an open-source onchain infrastructure that any aggregator can use, 1inch exchange and Tokenlon have actively been using the 0x exchange contracts to settle trades. Thus this portion of volume has an overlap with other aggregators‚Äô volume, but no overlap with other AMM DEXes.

### 2. The Aggregator Layer - 0x API (`/swap` endpoint)

0x API is the endpoint that allows any integrator or individual to fetch available quotes from "makers" to match their own "taker" order.

It is an off-chain order matching system that compares prices across:
* On-chain **bridge liquidity** (30+ AMM pools across chain like Uniswap, PancakeSwap, etc.)
* Off-chain **native liquidity** from RFQ system with Professional Market Makers‚Äô quotes
* Off-chain **native liquidity** from 0x‚Äôs Open Order Book network (known as mesh, accessed via 0x API `/sra` endpoint)

It returns the best price source (or sources) to users and prepares the routing information to be settled on chain ‚Äî by 0x exchange contracts (**native liquidity**) or other DEXes' contracts (**bridge liquidity**).

This portion has an overlap with other DEXes' volume as the bridge liquidity will be settled on their origin DEXes, but there‚Äôs no overlap with other aggregators.

For a list of all sources, see: [What exchange networks does Matcha aggregate liquidity from?](http://help.matcha.xyz/en/articles/4375069-what-exchange-networks-does-matcha-aggregate-liquidity-from)

### 3. The Application Layer - Matcha and other 0x API Integrators

[Matcha](https://matcha.xyz) is a user-facing product sitting on top of 0x API `/swap` and `/sra` endpoints. It fetches "maker" order via `/swap` endpoints for consumers‚Äô **market orders**; and submit "maker" order via `/sra` endpoints for consumers‚Äô **limit orders** which can later be sourced and potentially filled via `/swap` endpoint. Other integrators work in a similar way, but may include additional sources.

### 4. The Global Total - 0x Protocol

The term 0x Protocol is used to describe the total combined volume covering both 0x DEX layer (0x Native) and aggregator layer (0x API). As we mentioned above, 0x Native liquidity can potentially be "fetched" by 0x API as well, thus there is an overlap between these 2 attributions. We make sure to de-duplicate that part to avoid double counting.


### Summary
Below is a summary table for different attributions:

| Attribution | Availability on chains | Layer | Tag | Overlap with DEXes? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0x Native | Ethereum | Settlement Layer | DEX | No | native volume settled on 0x exchange contracts with fired events including Fill(), rfqOrderFilled() and limitOrderFilled() |
| 0x API | Ethereum, BSC, Polygon | Aggregator Layer | Aggregator | Yes | native + bridge volume going thru 0x API `/swap` endpoint |
| 0x API Integrator (e.g. Matcha) | Ethereum, BSC, Polygon | Application Layer | Aggregator (Integrator) | Yes | volume Integrator affiliated on top of 0x API `/swap` and `/sra` endpoints |
| **0x Protocol** | **Ethereum, BSC, Polygon** | **Global** | **DEX + Aggregator** | **Yes** | **combined total 0x volume with de-duplication of overlap** |

*Note: since 0x Native (native exchange contracts) are not deployed on chains outside Ethereum, 0x Protocol (global volume) is the same attribution as 0x API volume on BSC and Polygon at the moment.*

### 1.1 0xTracker

*For those looking for the easiest way to explore data.*

[0xTracker](https://0xtracker.com/) offers an easy to navigate interface to explore all 0x Protocol data, and tags each trade with the known entities involved. It allows the user to explore 0x data seamlessly through different cuts (API integrator, order book relayer, Market Maker, Trader).

Quick links to detailed views:

* [0x Protocol](https://0xtracker.com/network-insights) (global volume)
* [0x API](https://0xtracker.com/apps/0x-api)
* [Matcha](https://0xtracker.com/apps/matcha)
* All registered applications/integrators on 0x API and 0x Native contracts: [0xTracker - Apps](https://0xtracker.com/apps)

### 1.2 0xTracker API

*For those looking for a REST API endpoint.*

0xTracker also provides an API to access all the data available through the website, the docs are available at [0xTracker - API Docs](https://docs.0xtracker.com/api-reference/endpoints). This is ideal for all the teams working on analytics products willing to easily integrate 0x data from a reliable source.

Quick links:

* [0x Protocol](https://api.0xtracker.com/stats/network) (global volume)
* [0x API](https://api.0xtracker.com/apps/0x-api?statsPeriodFrom=2021-06-01&statsPeriodTo=2021-06-30)
* [0x API Integrator (e.g. Matcha)](https://api.0xtracker.com/apps/matcha?statsPeriodFrom=2021-06-01&statsPeriodTo=2021-06-30)


0xTracker is currently covering 0x on Ethereum Mainnet only. We at 0x Labs have plans to expand it so as to cover 0x in all other blockchains where 0x is present. We consider **0xTracker the first step towards a fully-fledged 0x Analytics hub**.

While we work on that, we have produced a set of Public Dashboards that cover 0x API on all available blockchains (see next section).

### 1.3 0x Public Dashboards

### 1.4 The Graph

*For those looking for a GraphQL endpoint.*

0x Labs maintains the subgraph for the latest 0x API `/swap` endpoint, which allows to explore **0x API** data on Ethereum:

- New subgraph: [0x-exchange-proxy](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph?id=0x36c057dd1850fad3c075ba83105e67d2448dedaf-0&version=0x36c057dd1850fad3c075ba83105e67d2448dedaf-0-0)
- Legacy subgraph: [Exchange V4](https://thegraph.com/legacy-explorer/subgraph/0xproject/exchange-v4)

Other chains' subgraphs are currently not planned as it requires reliable & in-sync subgraphs of certain DEXes from where liquidity is sourced.


### 1.5 Dune Analytics

### Disclaimer

We constantly work with the teams and maintain our external reporting on platforms mentioned above. Please refer to the list for reliable 0x data decoding. We are actively exploring partnerships with more data services and tools to expand external reporting offerings.

## üîé Decode it from Scratch (Advanced) ‚õìÔ∏è

Do you believe that the truth can only be found in the blockchain?
- If you don't have a data pipeline yet - our [event scraper](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-event-pipeline) is open source and only requires an RPC endpoint and a Postgres DB (Contributions are also welcome).
- If you already have a blockchain data ETL already, with the full copy of data processed into relational databases - our [folder](https://github.com/duneanalytics/abstractions/tree/master/ethereum/zeroex) under DuneAnalytics' collaborative repo will be the best reference.

Feel free to reach out to [danning@0xproject.com](mailto:danning@0xproject.com) (@sui414) and [jorge@0xproject.com](mailto:jorge@0xproject.com) (@ktl_xv) for any questions!

The data must flow. üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüîÆ
