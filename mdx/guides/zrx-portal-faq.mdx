# Terminologies
## What is a market maker?
In every 0x trade, there is a maker (the address who created the order) and a taker (the address that accepts the order and fills it). If you’re executing a market order, you will be a taker as these orders exist already in the order book. If you’re adding an order to the order book that takes time to be filled by other users, then you will be the maker of that order.

There is a particular category of traders, called market makers, that provide a significant amount of orders in 0x order books. Market makers are not the usual retail trader and are often incorporated as a business. Their function is to make it possible to have liquid markets with tight spreads between bid and ask and low slippage when executing large orders. These traders adopt specific strategies to benefit from their activity, realizing relatively small profits (out of order spreads) with high frequency. Market makers exist in ‘traditional’ markets and crypto markets across both centralized and decentralized exchanges.

## What are liquidity rewards?
For every trade where liquidity is sourced from 0x open order books (i.e., native 0x liquidity), a protocol fee proportional to the transaction's gas cost is collected from the takers of those orders. Every epoch, all protocol fees collected are accumulated into a collection pool and are automatically distributed to 0x market makers as liquidity rewards. To earn these liquidity rewards, market makers must create and manage a staking pool. The distribution of liquidity rewards to market maker staking pools are proportional to 1) the protocol fees generated by filled orders that the market maker created and 2) the pool’s stake of ZRX tokens. Market makers can either stake their own ZRX or invite others to stake their ZRX with their pool in exchange for a portion of the pool’s rewards earned. Market makers control the % of rewards they choose to share with external stakers.

Read [this blog post](https://blog.0xproject.com/0x-roadmap-2019-part-4-proposal-for-stake-based-liquidity-incentive-52c16558df29) for a detailed explanation of how liquidity rewards are calculated (see the “stake-based liquidity incentive” section).

## What is a staking pool?
0x marker makers are entitled to receive liquidity rewards in exchange for their activity, which is crucial for the efficient functioning of 0x markets. To collect these rewards, they need to stake ZRX tokens. To do so, they create staking pools, which allow them to stake their ZRX and attract other token holders’ ZRX, provided that they share a portion of rewards with them. By allowing other token holders to stake with them, they increase their ability to collect rewards.

## What is an epoch?
An epoch is a recurring period of 7 days used by the staking system to calculate and distribute eligible rewards to staking pools. Every state modification of the staking system (including a stake action) during the current epoch becomes effective in the next epoch.

## What are ‘rewards shared’?
Rewards shared is the ‘cut’ of liquidity rewards shared by the staking pool operator with the token holders staking with the pool. For example, a pool with 10% liquidity rewards shared will retain 90% of rewards earned from their market making activities and share the remaining 10% with token holders who have staked with their pool. Rewards shared with each token holder occur at the end of each epoch according to the amount of ZRX they staked. The metric is associated with the upcoming epoch (if the pool operator changed it during the current epoch).

## What are ‘average rewards shared’?
This quantity, expressed in ETH, is the average reward shared to delegators who have staked with the corresponding pool across the last three epochs. The final share per delegator depends on the quantity of ZRX staked. You can divide this quantity by the number of ZRX you have staked (or going to stake) to have an estimate of what you would have earned had you staked with the pool.

## What is saturation (previously called stake %, or stake ratio)?
Saturation is calculated by dividing the 'ZRX share' by the 'liquidity share.'

* ZRX share = the ZRX staked in the pool, divided by the total ZRX staked in the system
* Liquidity share = the fees attributed to the pool's makers, divided by the total fees generated by other market makers in staking pools

This metric applies to the upcoming epoch, as it estimates the upcoming epoch's saturation (the rewards calculation factors the ZRX staked at the beginning of the epoch).

To start staking, visit the ZRX Portal and connect a supported wallet (currently MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and WalletConnect-compatible wallets). Hardware wallet support is only available via MetaMask or Wallet Connect.

Staking involves two transactions, both requiring ETH for gas - 1) a one-time ZRX token approval transaction and 2) a staking transaction. Click on ‘Your Account’ to choose a staking pool or click on ‘Auto Stake’ to have the system choose a pool for you.

To start staking, visit the [ZRX Portal](https://0x.org/zrx/staking) and connect a supported wallet (currently MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and WalletConnect-compatible wallets). Hardware wallet support is only available via MetaMask or Wallet Connect.

Staking involves two transactions, both requiring ETH for gas:

1. a one-time ZRX token approval transaction
1. a staking transaction

Click on ‘Your Account’ to choose a staking pool or click on ‘Auto Stake’ to have the system choose a pool for you.

Enter the amount of ZRX you want to stake and then approve the ZRX contract (‘ZRX Allowance’). Make sure you have enough ETH for gas and then approve the transaction in your wallet. (For gas cost estimates of various staking transactions, view this dashboard.) If the approval transaction is successful, it will look like this in Etherscan:

Next, you must transfer your ZRX to the staking contract. Again, make sure you have enough ETH for gas and then approve the transaction in your wallet. If the staking transaction is successful, it will look like this in Etherscan:

You should now see your pending stake in the ZRX Portal and you will start earning liquidity rewards starting with the next epoch.

## I have staked with a pool. What now?
As you have seen in the staking flow's last steps, the stake comes into effect in the upcoming epoch. That means that if you have staked in epoch e, in epoch e+1, your stake will be active, and you'll be eligible to withdraw rewards at the start of epoch e+2. Keep your stake active to continue earning rewards. You can also move your stake to another pool or remove it from the system altogether.

## I want to remove my current stake. What should I do?
Staking involves two transactions, both requiring ETH for gas - 1) an un-staking transaction that transfers any earned ETH liquidity rewards back to your wallet, and 2) a token removal transaction that transfers your ZRX back to your wallet. Please note that after the first transaction, you must wait until the current epoch ends before performing the second transaction.

First, visit the [ZRX Portal](https://0x.org/zrx/staking) and connect your wallet. Next, click ‘Remove’ to remove your staked ZRX from the system. This action will also withdraw your accumulated liquidity rewards. Approve the transaction, and your rewards will be sent to your wallet (in WETH). After the epoch ends, return to the ZRX Portal, connect your wallet, click ‘Withdraw’ and approve the transaction, which will withdraw your ZRX back to your wallet.

## Why can’t I stake or un-stake my ZRX?
The most common cause of problems with staking is that you don’t have enough ETH in your wallet to pay for the transaction gas. Your wallet may not alert you that this is the case. In most cases, adding ETH to your wallet will resolve the problem. For gas cost estimates of various staking transactions, [view this dashboard](https://duneanalytics.com/queries/19394/39637).

# Staking liquidity rewards
## How are rewards distributed?
Rewards are denominated in ETH (but distributed in WETH). You will be able to withdraw rewards earned through staking from [your account page](https://0x.org/zrx/account). If you’re a staking pool operator, your rewards will be automatically distributed at the end of each epoch.

## How do I claim my staking rewards?
You can claim your rewards at any time by going to the ZRX Portal, connecting your wallet, and clicking ‘Withdraw Rewards.’ As long as your ZRX remains staked, your rewards will continue to accrue with no deadline to withdraw them. To avoid spending gas unnecessarily, we recommend letting your rewards accrue vs. withdrawing them periodically (which requires gas on each withdrawal).

## What is the staking APY?
Staking APY is typically calculated from epoch-to-epoch and may vary from pool to pool. Recent staking APYs by epoch can be found [here](https://duneanalytics.com/queries/4007/7804).

## What is the best staking pool?
There isn't a one-size-fits-all answer to this question. The ZRX Portal includes an auto-stake feature that chooses the best pool for you given current market maker performance and staking pool parameters. As conditions change, you may see higher returns in a different pool, in which case you will need to decide whether you want to move your stake there manually. One popular strategy we've observed for those with enough tokens has been to stake into multiple pools to offset the possibility of being in an under-performing pool.

If at some point you decide to move your stake to a different pool, to avoid losing staking rewards earned during the current epoch, choose the 'Move Stake' option in the staking portal interface rather than 'Remove Stake.' The 'Move Stake' option will keep you staked, thus allowing you to continue earning rewards through the current epoch and move your stake at the start of the next epoch. The 'Remove Stake' option requires you to withdraw your stake back to your wallet before you can stake again.

## What does it mean when a pool is under or over saturated (under or over-staked)?
The rewards per unit of ZRX collected by a pool are maximized when saturation is equal to 1. Saturation is calculated by dividing the 'ZRX share' by the 'liquidity share.'

* ZRX share = the ZRX staked in the pool, divided by the total ZRX staked in the system
* Liquidity share = the fees attributed to the pool's makers, divided by the total fees generated by other market makers in staking pools

When these two quantities are equal, the pool stake ratio is 1 (100%), and the rewards per unit of ZRX staked are maximized. When the staking pool is under-staked (the relative share of ZRX is smaller than the liquidity share), the pool will not be allocated the entirety of the eligible rewards. Increasing the balance of ZRX staked (by a market maker adding it or incentivizing other token holders to delegate their tokens) will progressively maximize the liquidity rewards received. As a delegator, it's essential to evaluate the quantity of ZRX that one is about to stake. All things being equal (protocol fees generated and rewards shared), choosing a less saturated pool will generate higher rewards, as it means that there are fewer ZRX staked in the pool. When in doubt, use the staking wizard to help you decide which pool to stake.

## The pool I am staking with is not accumulating protocol fees but has a high amount of ZRX staked. Will I receive rewards?
No. As explained above, the rewards distributed are proportional to the ZRX staked in the pool and the protocol fees generated by orders created by the maker maker registered with the staking pool. If any of these two quantities is 0, rewards will be 0.  Also, note that there is a minimum of 100 ZRX staked needed to receive rewards.

# Miscellaneous questions
## What wallets are currently supported in the ZRX Portal?
ZRX Portal supports [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), [Coinbase Wallet](https://wallet.coinbase.com/), and [WalletConnect-integrated wallets](https://walletconnect.org/wallets). You can connect your Ledger or Trezor hardware wallets to Metamask or WalletConnect. If you use a Ledger, make sure that the ‘Contract Data’ setting is enabled.

## Is staking secure?
Staking is very secure. In addition to thorough testing by 0x Labs, top blockchain security companies, Trail of Bits, and ConsenSys Diligence audited the 0x staking contracts. You can review their audit results here:

* [Trail of Bits audit results](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/0x-protocol.pdf)
* [ConsenSys Diligence audit results](https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2019/10/0x-v3-staking/)

## I am marketing making on 0x. Do you recommend that I create a staking pool?
Yes! You should create a staking pool, as you are eligible for rewards that would otherwise be distributed to other pools. You can refer to [this guide](https://0x.org/docs/guides/create-staking-pool) on how to create and manage a staking pool.

## I am not a market maker, but I hold ZRX. Do you recommend that I stake my tokens?
Yes! We encourage you to use the [ZRX Portal](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-protocol-specification/blob/3.0/staking/staking-specification.md#62-paying-liquidity-rewards-finalization) to stake your tokens with a staking pool and start earning ETH liquidity rewards. If you’re unsure about which staking pool to stake with, use the staking wizard, which will always recommend the best pool based on current conditions.

## Why is the staking pool that I created not listed on the ZRX Portal?
The ZRX Portal filters out pools that either do not have any ZRX staked or that are not generating any protocol fees.
