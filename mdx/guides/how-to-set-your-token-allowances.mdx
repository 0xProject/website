# How to set your token allowances

Some interactions with 0x will require or be improved by setting token allowances,
or in other words, giving our smart contracts permission to move certain tokens on your behalf. 
Depending on the context, you will have to provide an allowance to one of the [AssetProxy](/docs/guides/v3-specification#assetproxy) contracts
or [StakingProxy](/docs/guides/v3-staking-specification#architecture) contract. 
You can look up the addresses for our smart contract deployments in the [0x cheat sheet](/docs/guides/0x-cheat-sheet#mainnet-1).

You can read more about [the ERC20 token allowance function](https://tokenallowance.io/), but this guide will focus on how to set them.


## Setting Allowances on Etherscan

There are a lot of dApps that let you set your allowances in Metamask (including [RadarRelay](https://app.radarrelay.com/)).
Here we will use Etherscan as they allow you to interact with any smart contract. 
To set your WETH allowance for the ERC20AssetProxy contract you can navigate to the [Dapp view for the WETH ERC20](https://etherscan.io/dapp/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2#writeContract) contract.
Here you can use Metamask to call the `approve` method to approve the ERC20AssetProxy for the max uint256 amount which is `115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935`.

You can give a WETH allowance to any smart contract this way. To set your allowance for a different token, you'll have to navigate to the smart contract interface for that token.


## Setting Allowances with Web3.js

All code snippets provided are designed to work in a browser environment with an injected web3 instance (like [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)). 
You can use the [npm web3 module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3) and modify these snippets to run them in a node environment.

```
import { ERC20TokenContract } from '@0x/contract-wrappers';
import { BigNumber } from '@0x/utils';
import { getContractAddressesForChainOrThrow } from '@0x/contract-addresses';

(async () => {
    const web3 = window.web3;
    // Set up proxy approval
    const USDCaddress = '0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48';
    const USDCcontract = new ERC20TokenContract(USDCaddress, web3.eth.currentProvider);
    const maxApproval = new BigNumber(2).pow(256).minus(1);

    // Send the approval to the 0x ERC20Proxy smart contract
    const chainId = 1;
    const contractAddresses = getContractAddressesForChainOrThrow(chainId);
    const approvalTxData = USDCcontract
        .approve(contractAddresses.erc20Proxy, maxApproval)
        .getABIEncodedTransactionData();
    await web3.eth.sendTransaction(approvalTxData);
})();
```
