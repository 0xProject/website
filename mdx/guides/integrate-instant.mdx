# Introduction

0x Instant is a product built by 0x community that offers a convenient way for people to get access to a wide variety of tokens and other crypto-assets in just a few clicks. Developers can integrate the free, open source library into their applications or websites in order to both offer seamless access to crypto-assets, as well as gain a new source of revenue, with just a few lines of code.

## Libraries

0x Instant has the library `0x Instant UI component` that users will see  and is powered by 0x API. Check out the `0x API` documentation [here](https://0x.org/docs/api). Check out the Instant Github repo [here](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-instant)


## Affiliate Fees

As an end host of 0x Instant, you can charge users a fee on all trades made through Instant with the `affiliateFee` option. Simply specify an ethereum address and feePercentage (up to 5%), and a percentage of each transaction will be deposited into the specified address (denominated in the bought tokens).

# UI Integration

The 0x Instant UI powered by 0x API are bundled together in a convenient JS package for you. You can either download and serve the package yourself, or use the CDN-hosted version from 0x community.

# Examples


## With token list

Check all others token lists on [List Repository](https://tokenlists.org/) or create one following the [specification](https://github.com/Uniswap/token-lists) and host it on Github

```typescript
zeroExInstant.render(
    {
        tokenList: 'https://tokens.coingecko.com/uniswap/all.json',
    },
    'body',
);
```

## Providing your own provider

This will give you more control over what provider is passed in and where RPC calls are directed

```typescript
zeroExInstant.render(
    {
        provider: window.ethereum,
        walletDisplayName: 'Trust Wallet',
    },
    'body',
);
```

## Providing a Default Token In

```typescript
zeroExInstant.render(
    {
       defaultSelectedTokenIn: '0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498'
    },
    'body',
);
```

## Example of Swap Token In by Token out with defined amount

```typescript
zeroExInstant.render(
    {
       defaultSelectedTokenIn: '0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498',
       defaultSelectedTokenOut: '0x1985365e9f78359a9b6ad760e32412f4a445e862',
       defaultAmountTokenIn: 10000000000,
    },
    'body',
);
```

## Providing your own callback handler

```typescript
zeroExInstant.render(
    {
        onSuccess: txHash => {
            console.log('Success! Transaction hash is: ' + txHash);
        },
    },
    'body',
);
```

# Learn about affiliate fees

As an end host of 0x Instant, you can charge users a fee on all trades made through Instant with the `affiliateFee` option. Simply specify an ethereum address and feePercentage (up to 5%), and a percentage of each transaction will be deposited into the specified address (denominated in bought tokens). If no affiliate address is specified it defaults to zero address.

Example: 3% of transaction volume (in ETH) will be deposited into 0x50ff5828a216170cf224389f1c5b0301a5d0a230

```typescript
zeroExInstant.render(
    {
        affiliateInfo: {
            feeRecipient: '0x50ff5828a216170cf224389f1c5b0301a5d0a230',
            feePercentage: 0.03,
        },
    },
    'body',
);
```

# Roadmap

- Integration of all chains that 0x API supports:

    - [x] Ethereum 
    - [ ] BSC 
    - [ ] Polygon
    - [ ] Avalanche
    - [ ] Fantom
    - [ ] Celo


# FAQs

## General

### Q: What is a provider?

Check out this [article](/docs/guides/web3-provider-explained) in the guides section for an explanation of web3 providers. A dApp developer typically grabs this object from window.ethereum or window.web3.currentProvider. For advanced usage of providers check out the [examples](/docs/guides/web3-provider-explained#web3-provider-examples) of how to create your own providers

### Q: Can I swap through 0x Instant  ERC-20 tokens like WETH or DAI?

0x Instant supports any ERC20 <-> ERC20 swaps.

### Q: Which networks will Instant supports?

Instant supports at the moment only ETH network, support for networks for BSC, Polygon, Fantom, Celo and Avalanche are on Roadmap.

### Q: This project has a roadmap?

Check the roadmap [here](#roadmap)


## Mobile

### Q: How can I make 0x Instant work in my mobile app?

For apps using React Native or apps that have a web view, the 0x API will work out of the box with your application. For apps that are written in a native language like Java or Swift, you will need to wrap the asset-swapper logic in a JS interpreter.

## Affiliates

### Q: How do I make money as an affiliate?

If you host 0x Instant, you can designate an address that you own to receive a small % of bought tokens that users spend on assets. The fee percent maxes out at 5%. You can configure this in the AffiliateInfo setting.

### Q: Do I need to set an affiliate?

Affiliate info is optional.


## Support

### Q: How can I get help integrating Instant?

Create question on [StackExchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/0x)

### Q: Who maintains this package?

This package is maintained by  community member @JoaoCampos89 under a grant gave by "the 0x community"

### Q: I found a bug on instant?

Please open issue on [Instant Github](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-instant/issues)

### Q: The token that I want to swap keeps failling?

Instant powered by 0x API supports any Token that has liquidity and follows ERC20 standard. Tokens that not follow ERC20 standard can fail as for instance deflationary or with buy back functions.
