**Contract fillable liquidity (CFL)** is the ability for smart contracts to programmatically swap tokens by filling orders on decentralized exchanges. This opens up new abilities for DeFi protocols, such as:

- Seamlessly swap between ETH ↔ DAI ↔ MKR, allowing users to effectively interact with CDPs (Collateral Debt Positions) with ETH instead of MKR
- Use your margin trading protocol to offer users deep liquidity pools with competitive slippages
- Easily rebalance portfolios with atomic token swaps

**Contract fillable liquidity** allows for better user experiences to be created for your DeFi product/protocol, and with [0x API](/0x-api) users can experience the best prices available across the DEX ecosystem. 

## Navigating the world of contract fillable liquidity with 0x protocol

If you are just learning about contract fillable liquidity and the 0x protocol, don’t fret, let’s walk through the journey of liquidity from its origination point to its eventual consumption by your smart contracts.

1. Orders, A “unit of liquidity” in the 0x protocol

    Orders, 0x's representation of liquidity, are promises from one user, the maker, to swap a certain token with another token at a specified rate. The 0x protocol specifies a specific format that all 0x orders [abide to](/docs/core-concepts#the-0x-order-message-format). For a number of large asset pairs (i.e ETH/DAI, ETH/USDC), professional market makers produce a constant stream of orders thereby providing a consistent source of liquidity at competitive rates.

2. Networked Liquidity, sharing orders to the world

    After 0x orders are created and signed by market makers, they need to reach takers; this is where 0x Mesh comes in. 0x Mesh is a P2P protocol that creates a decentralized global “networked” pool of liquidity. Networked liquidity, unlike the fragmented nature of traditional, centralized, financial markets/exchanges, guarantees takers are getting the best price 0x protocol can offer.

3. 0x API, Simple + Easy interface to networked liquidity

    While any developer or user can directly interact with 0x Mesh, the lower level nature of the P2P protocol requires a deep understanding of 0x protocol to properly utilize. 0x API offers a higher level interface to consume liquidity from 0x Mesh and other DEX sources. With its familiar HTTP interface, 0x API makes *“I need to buy 10 DAI” *or *“I need to sell 1.5 Ether”* only a GET call away.

4. Filling 0x orders, interacting with 0x Protocol Contracts

    At some point, to utilize the provided response from the API, your smart contract will need to interact with 0x protocol’s smart contracts. Similar to STL in C++, 0x Protocol Smart Contracts is the core “library” that smart contracts leverage to “fill” orders and enable exchange functionality. With the provided `calldata` sent to your smart contract as a parameter, a simple `.call.value()()` will execute the swap.
