# Use 0x API Liquidity in Your Smart Contracts

 Allow your users to do simple atomic token swaps in your dApp with 0x API. This guide assumes that you are comfortable with the concept of [leveraging networked liquidity within a smart contract](./introduction-to-using-0x-liquidity-in-smart-contracts.mdx). 

## Overview

After you complete this guide, you will have a smart-contract that swaps Ether for DAI, powered by 0x API.

This smart contract is implemented in three steps:

1. Use 0x API to fetch a quote for a specified swap. This will return the necessary `callData` to complete the swap on the 0x Protocol contract. 
2. Make a 0x Protocol contract call with the provided `callData`.
3. Fill 0x orders in your smart contract.

Let‚Äôs get started!

## Set up your off-chain web3 environment 

We will use our [0x API starter project](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-api-starter-guide-code), which has a basic setup for developing smart contracts and interacting with them on ganache. 

<Notification>This project leverages the 0x Core Team‚Äôs smart contract development tooling, which is generally similar to other development tooling like truffle. If there are noteworthy differences, we will highlight them within this guide.</Notification>

Begin by cloning the starter project and installing dependencies:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/0xProject/0x-api-starter-guide-code
$ cd 0x-api-starter-guide-code
$ npm install
```

For development, we will create a ganache network that forks Ethereum‚Äôs mainnet state. On the fork, we can safely interact with DeFi protocols without consuming real ether. The starter project includes a script that sets up the fork for you. 

### Configure the .env file

```
ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545
MNEMONIC=<INSERT_MNEMONIC_HERE>
```

For the mnemonic, because we are using a mainnet forked ganache environment, use an account that has some amount of ether on mainnet. In the ganache environment, the fork will have your account with ether ready to be used to deploy and interact with smart contracts. **Warning: use a test account, DO NOT use an account with your personal savings.**

## Fetch a quote from 0x API 

The starter project contains a script that runs web3 interactions with your smart contract, mimicking the behavior of an imaginary DApp front-end. In this example, imagine that a user wants to execute a transaction requiring DAI, but this user only owns ETH. The DApp programmatically swaps ETH for the required DAI and executes the original transaction without any extra input from the user. 

We first use 0x API to get a competitively priced quote for the token swap. By specifying `buyAmount` instead of `sellAmount`, the API understands you intend to buy 1 unit of DAI, not sell 1 unit of Ether.

Open `examples/simple_contract_token_swap.ts` and add the following snippet:

```
// examples/simple_contract_token_swap.ts

// 1. call 0x API for a quote for one dollar of DAI.
const buyAmount = baseUnitAmount(1); // we want to buy 1 unit of DAI
const sellAmount = undefined; // we should only specify sellAmount if we want to sell ETH instead of buying DAI

const params = {
    sellToken: 'ETH',
    buyToken: 'DAI',
    buyAmount: buyAmount.toString(),
    sellAmount: sellAmount.toString(),
}

const res = await fetch(`${SWAP_URL}/quote?${qs.stringify(params)}`);
const quote = await res.json();

console.log('Received quote:', quote);
```

Note: `baseUnitAmount` adjusts the supplied integer by the number of decimals an asset has. In DAI‚Äôs case, there are 18 decimal places; `baseUnitAmount` would be buying 1 DAI.

Run the script:
`$ npm run test:simple_contract_token_swap`

It will take some time to start the ganache environment, but will eventually fetch a quote from 0x API. You should see the quote printed out with the following structure:

```
Received quote: {
  to: '0xa3ac9844514b96bb502627ca9dceb57c4be289e3',
  data: '0x942d33c0000000000000000000000000000000000000...
  value: '8078746250988326',
  gasPrice: '8000000000',
  ...
}
```

This is a valid Ethereum transaction that you can execute directly from your address to test the swap. We will refer to this as the ‚Äúswap transaction‚Äù, to differentiate from the original user transaction. Let‚Äôs imagine that the DApp smart contract needs to perform some additional steps before proceeding with the original user transaction. For now, the DApp front-end should not swap the tokens yet, and must pass the quote to the DApp smart contract instead.

### Set up your on-chain smart contract 

0x API starter project contains a smart contract development environment. We need to make some additions to `contracts/SimpleTokenSwapContract.sol`.


```
// contracts/SimpleTokenSwapContract.sol

pragma solidity ^0.5.9;
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

import "@0x/contracts-exchange-forwarder/contracts/src/interfaces/IForwarder.sol";

contract SimpleTokenSwapContract
{
    IForwarder internal FORWARDER;
    constructor (address _forwarder)
        public
    {
        FORWARDER = IForwarder(_forwarder);
    }
    
    ...

    // TODO: Add a function that executes the transaction provided by the API
}
```

In the solidity code, we have imported the file `IForwarder.sol`. IForwarder is the 0x protocol interface that we will use to execute the transaction. The `to` address provided in the 0x API quote is the address of the `Forwarder` contract deployed on mainnet.

Recall that in our example, the user wants to execute a transaction requiring DAI, but they only own ETH. The DApp front-end detected this and obtained a quote for buying DAI. However, the original transaction required some preliminary steps in the DApp smart contract before it could be executed. Let‚Äôs imagine that the DApp smart contract has now verified that we want to proceed with the original transaction, so we are now ready to execute the swap transaction. 

Let‚Äôs begin by adding the type definition of the function that requires a token swap:

```
function functionThatRequiresDAI(bytes memory callDataHex) // the data provided by 0x API, containing the necessary payload to execute the swap transaction
    public
    payable // MUST be payable as we will be performing a swap with the user's ether value
    returns (bool)
{
    return false;
}
```


Next, pass the callData to the `Forwarder` contract:


```
function functionThatRequiresDAI(bytes memory callDataHex)
    public
    payable
    returns (bool)
{
    (bool success, bytes memory _data) = address(FORWARDER).call.value(msg.value)(callDataHex);
    // TODO: execute original user transaction that requires DAI
    return success;
}
```

Assuming `success` is true, we have just written our first smart contract that uses 0x API‚Äôs liquidity! The returned  `_data` contains more information relating to the executed swap.

Let‚Äôs compile and build the smart contract we just wrote: 

```
npm run build_contracts
```

With that, your smart contract is ready to be used! üéâ

Veteran DeFi developers will note the trivial nature of the written contract. Please **do not** deploy and use this on mainnet! In more advanced guides, we will be talking about our recommended engineering practices for verifying the swap successfully happened, and other more nuanced aspects of using networked liquidity from a contract. 

### Execute the swap 

Let‚Äôs put it all together to see what the user experience would be like. 

0x tools make it easy to interact with our new smart contract by automatically generating a TypeScript wrapper. We need to import the new wrapper and instantiate it:

```
// examples/simple_contract_token_swap.ts

import { ERC20TokenContract } from '@0x/contracts-erc20'

import { SimpleTokenSwapContractContract } from '../generated-wrappers/simple_token_swap_contract';

// 1. call 0x API for a quote for one unit of DAI.

...

// 2. send response from 0x api to your smart contract

const userAddresses = await web3Wrapper.getAvailableAddressesAsync();
const from = userAddresses[0];

const contract = new SimpleTokenSwapContractContract(simpleTokenSwapAddress, provider);
```

Now let‚Äôs execute the transaction with our new smart contract: 

```
try {
    console.log(`contract dai balance before: ${await daiContract.balanceOf(simpleTokenSwapAddress).callAsync()}`);
    const txHash = await contract.functionThatRequiresDAI(quote.data).sendTransactionAsync({
        from,
        value: quote.value,
        gasPrice: quote.gasPrice,
        gas: 300000,
    });
    console.log(`contract dai balance after: ${await daiContract.balanceOf(simpleTokenSwapAddress).callAsync()}`);
} catch (e) {
    console.log(e)
}
```

Note how we are sending `quote.data` as the provided parameter to `functionThatRequiresDAI`. Because of the trivial nature of the function, we will be simply passing `value` and `gasPrice` from the quote, unaltered. 

With this, run the script with `npm test:simple_token_swap` and you should see:

```
contract dai balance before: 0
contract dai balance after: 10000000000000000000
```

Voila! Your smart contract now has a balance of 1 DAI. You have just used 0x API‚Äôs liquidity in a smart contract for the first time!
