# Unlocking meta-transaction swaps With 0x API

0x protocol has had native support for a trade to occur as a meta-transaction since V2, and we have now added this support to 0x API. This guide will walk you though integrating with 0x API in such a way that enables your users to benefit from a meta-transactions flow.

**Note:** This tutorial assumes your users already have their allowances set to 0x protocol. If you haven't dealt with allowances before, checkout out our guide on [How to Set your Token Allowances](https://0x.org/docs/guides/how-to-set-your-token-allowances#setting-allowances-on-etherscan).

### Why support meta-transactions?

1. Remove the need for your users to own ETH and understand gas
2. Subsidize the gas & protocol fees for your users
3. Simplify the trading experience by requiring users to simply sign a message rather than broadcast an Ethereum transaction

## Step-by-step instructions

### Fetch indicative quotes

While a user is browsing your application, deciding what to swap, and how much they'd potentially want to sell, you can send requests to [/meta-transactions/v0/price](/docs/api#get-metatxnv0price) and it will return indicative quotes. An indicative quote is a non-binding estimation of the price a trader would receive by filling an order at the time the quote is sent. This price can be displayed to the user in your UI so they have a sense for what price is available to them.

```
import * as qs from 'qs';

(async () => {
    // buying 1 DAI with ETH
    const params = {
        takerAddress: YOUR_USERS_TAKER_ADDRESS,
        buyToken: 'DAI',
        sellToken: 'ETH',
        buyAmount: '1000000000000000000',
    }
    
    const response = await fetch(
        `https://api.0x.org/meta_transaction/v0/price?${qs.stringify(params)}`
    );
 
    await window.web3.eth.sendTransaction(await response.json());
})();
```

### Fetch a firm quote

Once the user has signaled they are intent on making a trade (e.g., clicked a button saying "Buy" or "Swap Now"), you must make a firm request via the [/meta-transactions/v0/quote](/docs/api#get-metatxnv0quote) endpoint. This firm quote will return the hash of a [0x transaction](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-protocol-specification/blob/master/v3/v3-specification.md#transactions) specifying the specifics of the trade (e.g., price, orders and amount to fill). 

```
import * as qs from 'qs';

(async () => {
    // buying 1 DAI with ETH
    const params = {
        takerAddress: YOUR_USERS_TAKER_ADDRESS,
        buyToken: 'DAI',
        sellToken: 'ETH',
        buyAmount: '1000000000000000000',
    }
    
    const response = await fetch(
        `https://api.0x.org/meta_transaction/v0/quote?${qs.stringify(params)}`
    );
 
    await window.web3.eth.sendTransaction(await response.json());
})();
```

In order for the user to agree to the trade, they must sign the 0x transaction hash. They can do this using an externally owned account via an EC signature. If they trade from a smart wallet contract, they can sign it with their controlling private key using an [EIP1271 signature](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-protocol-specification/blob/master/v3/v3-specification.md#eip1271wallet).

### Execute the trade

Once the user has signed the 0x transaction, supply the signature and 0x transaction to the [/meta-transactions/v0/submit](/docs/api#get-metatxnv0submit) endpoint. This endpoint will do one of two things:

1. Submit the Ethereum transaction executing the trade encoded in the 0x transaction
2. Return an unsigned Ethereum transaction that executes the 0x transaction. 

(1) occurs if the request is sent with a whitelisted `0x-api-key` header (reach out to us about this possibility) or if a market maker supply some of the liquidity is willing to pay the gas + protocol fee. If neither of those cases are met, it returns the unsigned Ethereum transaction for either the end user or integrator/dApp to sign and broadcast. In order to get the benefits of meta-transactions, it's best to have someone other than the end-user submit the transaction on-chain.

```
(async () => {    
    const response = await fetch(
        `https://api.0x.org/meta_transaction/v0/submit`, {
            method: 'POST',
            body: JSON.stringify({
                signature: 0X_TRANSACTION_SIGNATURE,
                zeroExTransaction: 0X_TRANSACTION,
            }),
        },
    );
 
    await window.web3.eth.sendTransaction(await response.json());
})();
```

If an unsigned Ethereum transaction is returned, you must sign and broadcast it on behalf of your user. If it was signed and broadcast by 0x API, the response will contain the Ethereum transaction hash and the encoded, signed Ethereum transaction. The former can be used to track the transaction on Etherscan or otherwise, while the latter can be used to re-broadcast the transaction if necessary.

If you followed the above steps, you have successfully completed a trade using a meta-transactions flow!
