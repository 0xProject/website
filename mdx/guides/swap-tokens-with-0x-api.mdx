# Swap tokens with 0x API

0x API aggregates offers from multiple decentralized exchanges to ensure that you always receive the best price when swapping tokens. 

In this guide, we refer to “swap” and “quote” interchangeably. A “quote” is a response from the 0x API describing a transaction that, if executed, would swap the specified tokens.

All code snippets provided are designed to work in a browser environment with an injected web3 instance (like [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)). You can use the [npm web3 module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3) and modify these snippets to run them in a node environment.

## Swap ETH for 1 DAI

Perform a simple token swap to buy 1 DAI with ETH:

```
import * as qs from 'qs';

(async () => {
    // buying 1 DAI with ETH
    const params = {
        buyToken: 'DAI',
        sellToken: 'ETH',
        buyAmount: '1000000000000000000',
    }
    
    const response = await fetch(
        `https://api.0x.org/swap/v0/quote?${qs.stringify(params)}`
    );
 
    await window.web3.eth.sendTransaction(await response.json());
})();
```

Behind the scenes, 0x API gets the best rate across the DEX ecosystem by aggregating liquidity from Kyber, Uniswap, Oasis, and more. The API response is a valid Ethereum transaction. 

## Sell 1 ETH for DAI

The above example demonstrates how to buy 1 DAI with ETH. We can easily sell 1 ETH for *x* DAI too:

```
import * as qs from 'qs';

(async () => {
    // selling 1 ETH for DAI
    const params = {
        buyToken: 'DAI',
        sellToken: 'ETH',
        sellAmount: '1000000000000000000',
    }
    
    const response = await fetch(
        `https://api.0x.org/swap/v0/quote?${qs.stringify(params)}`
    );
    
    await window.web3.eth.sendTransaction(await response.json());
})();
```

Instead of specifying `buyAmount`, provide `sellAmount` in the params. If both are provided `sellAmount` is used over `buyAmount`. Refer to the [documentation](../api#get-swapv0quote) for more details.


## Swap ERC20 token pairs

Because this is a swap between ERC20 tokens, we need to give the [0x ERC20Proxy](./v3-specification#assetproxy) smart contract [an approval to move your tokens](/docs/guides/how-to-set-your-token-allowances) for you. 
Otherwise, the token swap works exactly as before:

```
import * as qs from 'qs';

import { ERC20TokenContract } from '@0x/contract-wrappers';
import { BigNumber } from '@0x/utils';
import { getContractAddressesForChainOrThrow } from '@0x/contract-addresses';

(async () => {
    const web3 = window.web3;
    // Set up proxy approval
    const USDCaddress = '0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48';
    const USDCcontract = new ERC20TokenContract(USDCaddress, web3.eth.currentProvider);
    const maxApproval = new BigNumber(2).pow(256).minus(1);

    // Send the approval to the 0x ERC20Proxy smart contract
    const chainId = 1;
    const contractAddresses = getContractAddressesForChainOrThrow(chainId);
    const approvalTxData = USDCcontract
        .approve(contractAddresses.erc20Proxy, maxApproval)
        .getABIEncodedTransactionData();
    await window.web3.eth.sendTransaction(approvalTxData);
    
    // buying 1 DAI with USDC
    const params = {
        buyToken: 'DAI',
        sellToken: 'USDC',
        buyAmount: '1000000000000000000',
    }
    
    const response = await fetch(
        `https://api.0x.org/swap/v0/quote?${qs.stringify(params)}`
        );
    
    await web3.eth.sendTransaction(await response.json());
})();
```

You can also request quotes with token addresses instead of symbols as `buyToken` or `sellToken`. Refer to the [documentation](../api#get-swapv0quote) for the full specification. 

## Specify a taker address for your swaps

You can optionally provide a `takerAddress` to get a specific `gas` amount to send with the swap transaction. 

The API performs an [`eth_call`](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_call) under the hood to catch any reverts that would occur if the `takerAddress` attempts to swap the tokens. An HTTP response with status 400 will be returned if the `eth_call` results in a revert (ie. the proposed swap fails), along with reasons for the revert.

```
import * as qs from 'qs';

(async () => {
    // selling 1 ETH for DAI
    const params = {
        buyToken: 'DAI',
        sellToken: 'ETH',
        sellAmount: '1000000000000000000',
        takerAddress: '0xAb5801a7D398351b8bE11C439e05C5B3259aeC9B', // vitalik's address
    }

    const response = await fetch(
        `https://api.0x.org/swap/v0/quote?${qs.stringify(params)}`
    );
    const responseJson = await response.json();
    if (response.ok) {
        await window.web3.eth.sendTransaction(responseJson);
    } else {
        // Contains the error
        console.log(responseJson);
    }
})();
```

## Diagnosing revert issues

Here is a handy checklist to go through if you encounter reverts:

* Does the `takerAddress` have enough balance? Check by comparing the `sellAmount` provided in the response of the endpoint against the `takerAddress`‘s `sellToken` balance.
* If `sellToken` is an ERC20 token (most tokens that are not `ETH`), the `takerAddress` will need to approve the 0x ERC20Proxy smart contract. [@0x/contract-addresses](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/blob/development/packages/contract-addresses/addresses.json) contains the most up-to-date address for the ERC20Proxy contract. 

## Find tokens available for swapping

0x API also offers a registry of swappable tokens and their respective symbols. This returns all tokens that have available quotes through the /quote endpoint. The registry is maintained and updated off-chain and we welcome [edits or additions](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-api/blob/master/src/token_metadatas_for_networks.ts)! 
<Notification>Note that this endpoint only reflects liquidity for symbols in the registry. You can also call the /swap endpoint with token addresses instead of symbols.</Notification>

```typescript
(async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.0x.org/swap/v0/tokens');
    const tokens = (await response.json()).records;
    console.log(`${JSON.stringify(tokens, null, 2)}`);
})();
```

Logs:

```json
[
    {
        "symbol": "DAI",
        "address": "0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f"
     },
     {
        "symbol": "REP",
        "address": "0x1985365e9f78359a9B6AD760e32412f4a445E862"
     },
     {
        "symbol": "WETH",
        "address": "0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2"
     },
     ...
]
```

## Understand the provided quote

The API response contains information about the terms and rate of the proposed swap:

```typescript
import * as qs from 'qs';

(async () => {
    // selling 1 ETH for DAI
    const params = {
        buyToken: 'DAI',
        sellToken: 'ETH',
        sellAmount: '1000000000000000000',
        takerAddress: '0xAb5801a7D398351b8bE11C439e05C5B3259aeC9B', // vitalik's address
    }

    const response = await fetch(
        `https://api.0x.org/swap/v0/quote?${qs.stringify(params)}`
    );
        
    const quote = await response.json();
    console.log(`price: ${quote.price}`); // the price of one ETH in DAI
    console.log(`buyAmount: ${quote.buyAmount}`); // amount of DAI to receive
    console.log(`sellAmount: ${quote.sellAmount}`); // amount of ETH to sell
    
    await window.web3.eth.sendTransaction(quote);
})();
```

Logs:

```
price: 170.016662957413269675
buyAmount: 170016662957413269675
sellAmount: 1000000000000000000
```

[Refer to the docs](../api#response-1) for other entries that you may want to inspect before executing the swap.

## Other ways to perform a token swap

With the response from the API, you can fill the quote in a number of ways:

* Like above, pass the response into `sendTransaction`

```typescript
const executeQuote = async (quote) => {
    await window.web3.eth.sendTransaction(quote);
};
```

* Leverage 0x TypeScript tooling like `@0x/asset-swapper` or `@0x/contract-wrappers`.
* Forward the quote to a smart contract to perform the swap on-chain. This relies on concepts introduced in [Introduction to Using 0x API Liquidity In Smart Contracts](./introduction-to-using-0x-api-liquidity-in-smart-contracts)

## Advanced features

### Use the gasPrice parameter to calculate protocol fees

0x V3 introduces a new protocol fee paid in ETH or WETH. The amount of this fee is dependent on gas price. You can provide an optional param `gasPrice` when requesting quotes to calculate an accurate `protocolFee`. If no `gasPrice` parameter is provided, the API will utilize the ‘fast’ `gasPrice` provided by [ethgasstation](https://ethgasstation.info/). If you execute the quote with a lower `gasPrice` than the one provided to the API, the protocol will refund the excess ETH.

Below we compare the differences in the price of the quote for different values of `gasPrice`:

```typescript
import * as qs from 'qs';

(async () => {
    // selling 1 ETH for DAI with varying gasPrices (in wei)
    [1, 5, 15].forEach(async gasPrice => {
        const params = {
            buyToken: 'DAI',
            sellToken: 'ETH',
            sellAmount: '1000000000000000000',
            gasPrice,
        }
        const response = await fetch(
            `https://api.0x.org/swap/v0/quote?${qs.stringify(params)}`
        );
        const quote = await response.json();
    
        console.log(`value for gasPrice of ${gasPrice} wei: ${quote.protocolFee}`);
    });
})();
```

```
value for gasPrice of 1 wei:  1000000000000070000
value for gasPrice of 5 wei:  1000000000000140000
value for gasPrice of 15 wei: 1000000000001050000
```

### Pay protocol fees in WETH

You can pay protocol fees in either ETH or WETH. If you intend to pay the protocol fee in WETH, you will need to make the following changes to your implementation:

* You will not be able to perform swaps with `sellToken` set as ETH _and_ pay protocol fee in WETH. Switch to using WETH as `sellToken` instead.
* To pay the `protocolFee` in WETH, the [0x Staking contract](./v3-specification#staking) will need an approval to access the WETH balance for `takerAddress`.
* Instead of passing the provided `value` in `sendTransaction`, pass `value: 0` since the fees are paid in WETH instead of the ETH sent along with the transaction.

```typescript
import * as qs from 'qs';

(async () => {
    // selling 1 WETH for DAI
    const params = {
        buyToken: 'DAI',
        sellToken: 'WETH',
        sellAmount: '1000000000000000000',
        takerAddress: '0xAb5801a7D398351b8bE11C439e05C5B3259aeC9B', // vitalik's address
    }

    const response = await fetch(
        `https://api.0x.org/swap/v0/quote?${qs.stringify(params)}`
    );

    const quote = await response.json();
    
    if (response.ok) {
        // set value to zero so protocol fee will be paid in WETH
        await window.web3.eth.sendTransaction({
            ...quote,
            value: 0, // override the value param
        });
    } else {
        // handle the error
    }
})();
```

### Choosing liquidity sources

With the `excludedSources` optional parameter in `swap/v0/quote`, you can specify which liquidity sources will not be used when providing a quote.

```javascript
import qs from 'qs';

(async () => {
    // selling 1 WETH for DAI
    const params = {
        buyToken: 'DAI',
        sellToken: 'WETH',
        sellAmount: '1000000000000000000',
        takerAddress: '0xAb5801a7D398351b8bE11C439e05C5B3259aeC9B', // vitalik's address
        excludedSources: 'Uniswap,Kyber', // provide a quote with only Eth2Dai and 0x native orders
    }

    const response = await fetch(
        `https://api.0x.org/swap/v0/quote?${qs.stringify(params)}`
    );

    const quote = await response.json();
    
    if (response.ok) {
        await window.web3.eth.sendTransaction({
            ...quote,
            ...{
                value: 0,
            }
        });
    } else {
        // handle the error
    }
})();
```
