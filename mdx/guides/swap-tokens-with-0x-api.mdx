# Swap tokens with 0x API

0x API aggregates offers from multiple decentralized exchanges to ensure that you always receive the best price when swapping tokens.

## Fetching a swap quote
Getting a swap quote from 0x-API is as easy as making an HTTP request. For example:

```js
const params = {
    buyToken: 'WETH',
    sellToken: 'DAI',
    buyAmount: '1000000000000000000000',
}
const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.0x.org/swap/v1/quote?${qs.stringify(params)}`
);
console.log(await response.json());
```

Will output something like:

```json
{
  "price": "0.002663907000981641",
  "guaranteedPrice": "0.002637267930971825",
  "to": "0xdef1c0ded9bec7f1a1670819833240f027b25eff",
  "data": "0xd9627aa40000000000000000000...",
  "value": "0",
  "gas": "111000",
  "estimatedGas": "111000",
  "gasPrice": "44000000000",
  "minimumProtocolFee": "0",
  "buyTokenAddress": "0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2",
  "sellTokenAddress": "0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f",
  "buyAmount": "2663907000981641103",
  "sellAmount": "1000000000000000000000",
  "allowanceTarget": "0xf740b67da229f2f10bcbd38a7979992fcc71b8eb"
}
```

The fields returned in a swap quote are designed to overlap with the raw transaction object accepted by [`web3.js`](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.3.0/)'s `sendTransaction()` function.

A description of each field is outlined in the [API reference](../../api/index#response).

## Quick examples

In these examples, we pass the quote object directly into `web3`'s `sendTransaction()` function. Because there is no `from` field in quote responses, these transactions will be sent from the default account associated with the ethereum node.

### Sell 1 ETH for DAI

This swaps a fixed quantity of our ETH for DAI.

```js
const params = {
    buyToken: 'DAI',
    sellToken: 'ETH',
    sellAmount: '1000000000000000000', // Always denominated in wei
}

const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.0x.org/swap/v1/quote?${qs.stringify(params)}`
);

await web3.eth.sendTransaction(await response.json());
```

### Buy 1 DAI with ETH

This swaps our ETH for a fixed quantity of DAI. Instead of specifying `sellAmount`, we provide `buyAmount`.

```js
const params = {
    buyToken: 'DAI',
    sellToken: 'ETH',
    buyAmount: '1000000000000000000', // Always denominated in wei
}

const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.0x.org/swap/v1/quote?${qs.stringify(params)}`
);

await web3.eth.sendTransaction(await response.json());
```

### Selling ERC20 tokens

Because ERC20 tokens cannot be attached to contract calls the way ETH can, an allowance must be set by the taker, for the token being sold, on the quote's `allowanceTarget` field prior to executing the swap. Otherwise, the token swap works exactly as before:

```js
const USDC_ADDRESS = '0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48';

// selling 1 DAI with USDC
const params = {
    buyToken: 'DAI',
    sellToken: 'USDC',
    sellAmount: '1000000000000000000',
}

const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.0x.org/swap/v1/quote?${qs.stringify(params)}`
);
const quote = await response.json();

// Set up a USDC spending allowance on the `allowanceTarget`.
const USDCcontract = new web3.eth.Contract(USDC_ABI, USDC_ADDRESS);
await USDCcontract.approve(quote.allowanceTarget, quote.sellAmount).send();

// Perform the swap.
await web3.eth.sendTransaction(await response.json());
```

## Specify a taker address for your swaps

You can optionally provide a `takerAddress` to get a correct, upper-limit `gas` amount to send with the swap transaction. Note that this currently only works with non-contract addresses.

The API performs an [`eth_estimateGas`](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_call) under the hood to catch any reverts that would occur if the `takerAddress` attempts to swap the tokens. An HTTP response with status 400 will be returned if the `eth_call` results in a revert (ie. the proposed swap fails), along with reasons for the revert.

```js
const params = {
    buyToken: 'DAI',
    sellToken: 'ETH',
    sellAmount: '1000000000000000000', // Always denominated in wei
    takerAddress: '0xAb5801a7D398351b8bE11C439e05C5B3259aeC9B', // vitalik's address
};

const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.0x.org/swap/v1/quote?${qs.stringify(params)}`
);

// The response will now include a `gas` field with correctly estimated.
await web3.eth.sendTransaction(await response.json());
```

## Using a custom gas price
By default, 0x-API will choose the median "fast" (<30s) gas price and compute the quote based around that. However, you explicitly provide a gas price with the `gasPrice` query parameter. Just like with other quantities, values for this parameter are in wei (e.g., 9 gwei = 9000000000).

## Paying protocol fees
Some quotes will require protocol fees to be filled. Protocol fees must be attached as ETH to the swap transaction. When required, the `value` field of the quote will have this fee reflected in it. Any fees that end up not being used will always be refunded to the sender/taker.

### Relationship to gas price
Protocol fees scale with gas price! This means you should always submit your transaction with the `gasPrice` field in the quote or else you may wind up not providing enough ETH to cover the protocol fee.

## Filtering liquidity sources

With the `excludedSources` and `includedSources` query parameters in `swap/v1/quote`, you can specify which liquidity sources will not be used when providing a quote. Multiple sources can be provided, separated by a comma. Note that these parameters are mutually exclusive.

- `excludedSources`: generate a quote *without* using this source.
- `includedSources`: generate a quote *only* using this source.

```javascript
const params = {
    buyToken: 'DAI',
    sellToken: 'ETH',
    sellAmount: '1000000000000000000', // Always denominated in wei
    excludedSources: 'Uniswap,Kyber' // Exclude uniswap and kyber
};

const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.0x.org/swap/v1/quote?${qs.stringify(params)}`
);

await web3.eth.sendTransaction(await response.json());
```

Eth2Dai
Kyber
LiquidityProvider
MStable

MultiHop

Swerve
Uniswap
UniswapV2
```

## Diagnosing revert issues

These are some common issues that can cause reverts:

* Does the taker have enough balance? Check by comparing the `sellAmount` provided in the response of the endpoint against the taker‘s `sellToken` balance.
* If `sellToken` is an ERC20 token (i.e., not `ETH`), ensure the taker has granted the `allowanceTarget` contract an allowance for the token being sold.
* Was the transaction submitted with the correct amount of ETH (the quote `value` field)?
* Was the transaction mined at a different gas price than the `gasPrice` field?

## Runnable example

The [0x API starter project](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-api-starter-guide-code) has a direct swap example that you can play around with at no cost by using a forked ganache instance.

## Wrapping up

Now that you’ve got your feet wet with 0x API, here are some other resources to make using 0x protocol as easy as possible:

* Refer to our [0x API specification](../api) for detailed documentation
* 0x API is [open source](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-api)! Look through the codebase and deploy your own 0x API instance.
