The swap API provides a method for performing token swaps (e.g. ETH to DAI) that aggregates offers from multiple DEXes to ensure you always receive the best price.
You can read more the in the [0x API specification](/docs/api).

All code snippets provided are designed to work in a browser environment with an injected web3 instance (like [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)). You can use the [npm web3 module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3) and modify these snippets to run them in a node environment.

## Buy 1 DAI with ETH

You can perform a two-line token swap like so: 

```javascript
(async () => {
    // buying 1 DAI with ETH
    const response = await fetch(
        'https://api.0x.org/swap/v0/quote?buyToken=DAI&sellToken=ETH&buyAmount=1000000000000000000'
    );
    
    await window.web3.eth.sendTransaction(await response.json());
})();
```

Behind the scenes, `/swap/v0/quote` is getting you the best rate across the DEX ecosystem by aggregating liquidity from 
sources like Kyber, Uniswap, Oasis and more. [Try it out!](https://codepen.io/fragosti/pen/xxbmgqy).

Since we used ETH as our `sellToken`, the API returned a [Forwarder](/docs/guides/v3-forwarder-specification) transaction,
which allowed us to get around setting [allowances](https://tokenallowance.io/) on any ERC20 tokens (including the `buyToken`).

## Selling ETH instead of buying DAI

The above example demonstrates how to buy 1 DAI with ETH, we can easily sell 1 ETH for X DAI like so: 

```javascript
import qs from 'qs';

(async () => {
    // selling 1 ETH for DAI
    const params = {
        buyToken: 'DAI',
        sellToken: 'ETH',
        sellAmount: '1000000000000000000',
    }
    
    const response = await fetch(
        `https://api.0x.org/swap/v0/quote?${qs.stringify(params)}`
    );
    
    await window.web3.eth.sendTransaction(await response.json());
})();
```

Instead of specifying `buyAmount`, provide `sellAmount` in the params. If both are provided `sellAmount` is used over `buyAmount`.

## Swapping between ERC20 token pairs

Because this is a swap between ERC20 tokens, you need to give the [0x ERC20Proxy](https://etherscan.io/address/0x95e6f48254609a6ee006f7d493c8e5fb97094cef) smart contract [approval](https://tokenallowance.io/) to move your tokens for you. 
Otherwise, the token swap works exactly the same way as before.

```javascript
import qs from 'qs';

(async () => {
    // buying 1 DAI with USDC
    const params = {
        buyToken: 'DAI',
        sellToken: 'USDC',
        buyAmount: '1000000000000000000',
    }
    
    const response = await fetch(
        `https://api.0x.org/swap/v0/quote?${qs.stringify(params)}`
    );
    
    await window.web3.eth.sendTransaction(await response.json());
})();
```

This time, the API returned a [`marketSellOrdersFillOrKill`](https://0x.org/docs/guides/v3-specification#marketsellordersfillorkill) transaction on the 0x exchange smart contract.

## Specifying a taker address for your swaps

You can optionally provide a `takerAddress` to get a specific gas amount to send with the swap transaction. 

The API will also perform a [`eth_call`](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_call) to catch any reverts that would occur if the `takerAddress` attempts to swap the tokens. 
An HTTP response with status `400` will be returned if the [`eth_call`](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_call) results in a revert (ie. the swap fails), along with reasons for the revert.

```javascript 
import qs from 'qs';

(async () => {
    // selling 1 ETH for DAI
    const params = {
        buyToken: 'DAI',
        sellToken: 'ETH',
        sellAmount: '1000000000000000000',
        takerAddress: '0xAb5801a7D398351b8bE11C439e05C5B3259aeC9B', // vitalik's address
    }

    const response = await fetch(
        `https://api.0x.org/swap/v0/quote?${qs.stringify(params)}`
    );
    const responseJson = await response.json();
    if (response.ok) {
        await window.web3.eth.sendTransaction(responseJson);
    } else {
        // Contains the error
        console.log(responseJson);
    }
})();
```

## Diagnosing issues with reverts

Here is a handy checklist to go through to diagnose a revert issue:

* Does the `takerAddress` have enough balance? Check by comparing the `sellAmount` provided in the response of the endpoint against the `takerAddress`‘s `sellToken` balance.
* If `sellToken` is an ERC20 token, (not ETH), the `takerAddress` will need to approve the [0x ERC20Proxy smart contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x95e6f48254609a6ee006f7d493c8e5fb97094cef).

## Seeing tokens available for swapping

The `/swap/v0/tokens` endpoint is useful to see a registry of all tokens and their respective token symbols available to swap through `/swap/v0/quote`. We maintain and update a registry of all the tokens (off-chain) and their token symbols available through `/swap/v0/quote`. Feel free to make edits or additions in the open-source repo [here](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-api).

```javascript
(async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.0x.org/swap/v0/tokens');
        
    const tokens = (await response.json()).records;
    
    console.log(JSON.stringify(tokens, null, 2));
})();
```

Logs:

```json
[
    {
        "symbol": "DAI",
        "address": "0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f"
     },
     {
        "symbol": "REP",
        "address": "0x1985365e9f78359a9B6AD760e32412f4a445E862"
     },
     {
        "symbol": "WETH",
        "address": "0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2"
     },
     ...
]
```

## Understanding the quote you are getting

The response of `/swap/v0/quote` provides a number of entries to easily understand the terms/rate of the swap you are performing.

```javascript
import qs from 'qs';

(async () => {
    // selling 1 ETH for DAI
    const params = {
        buyToken: 'DAI',
        sellToken: 'ETH',
        sellAmount: '1000000000000000000',
        takerAddress: '0xAb5801a7D398351b8bE11C439e05C5B3259aeC9B', // vitalik's address
    }

    const response = await fetch(
        `https://api.0x.org/swap/v0/quote?${qs.stringify(params)}`
    );
        
    const quote = await response.json();
    console.log(`price: ${quote.price}`); // the price of one ETH in DAI
    console.log(`buyAmount: ${quote.buyAmount}`); // amount of DAI to receive
    console.log(`sellAmount: ${quote.sellAmount}`); // amount of ETH to sell
    
    await window.web3.eth.sendTransaction(quote);
})();
```

Logs:

```json
price: 170.016662957413269675
buyAmount: 170016662957413269675
sellAmount: 1000000000000000000
```

Refer to the [docs](/docs/api) for other entries that you may want to inspect before executing the swap.

## Other ways to perform a token swap

With the response from the API, you can fill the quote in a number of ways:

* Like above, simply pass the response into sendTransaction

```javascript
const executeQuote = async (quote) => {
    await window.web3.eth.sendTransaction(quote);
};
```
* Leverage 0x typescript tooling like [@0x/asset-swapper](https://0.0.0.0:3572/docs/tools/asset-swapper/v3.0.3) or [@0x/contract-wrappers](https://0.0.0.0:3572/docs/tools/contract-wrappers/v13.3.0).
* Pass a few entries in the quote to a smart contract to perform the swap on-chain. Learn more [here](/docs/guides/abcs-of-contract-fillable-liquidity).

## Advanced features

### Changing the gasPrice parameter

In 0x v3, a new protocol fee (paid in ETH or WETH) that depends on gas price is introduced. 
Provide the optional param `gasPrice` so 0x API can calculate an accurate `protocolFee` for the quote. If no `gasPrice` parameter is provided, the API will utilize the ‘fast’ gasPrice provided by [ethgasstation](https://ethgasstation.info/). If you decide to use a lower `gasPrice` than the one provided to the API, the protocol will refund the excess ETH paid.

Below we compare the differences in the price of the quote for different provided values of `gasPrice`.

```javascript
import qs from 'qs';

(async () => {
    // selling 1 ETH for DAI with varying gasPrices (in wei)
    [1, 5, 15].forEach(async gasPrice => {
        const params = {
            buyToken: 'DAI',
            sellToken: 'ETH',
            sellAmount: '1000000000000000000',
            gasPrice,
        }
        const response = await fetch(`https://api.0x.org/swap/v0/quote?${qs.stringify(params)}`);
        const quote = await response.json();
    
        console.log(`value for gasPrice of ${gasPrice} wei: ${quote.protocolFee}`);
    });
})();
```

Logs: 

```javascript
value for gasPrice of 1 wei:  1000000000000150000
value for gasPrice of 5 wei:  1000000000000750000
value for gasPrice of 15 wei: 1000000000002250000
```

### Paying the fee in WETH

You can pay protocol fees in either ETH or WETH. If you intend to pay the protocol fee in WETH a few changes to your implementation are needed:

* You will not be able to perform swaps with `sellToken` set as ETH and pay protocol fee in WETH. Switch to using WETH as `sellToken` instead.
* To pay the `protocolFee` in WETH, the [0x Staking contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa26e80e7dea86279c6d778d702cc413e6cffa777) will need an approval to access `takerAddress` WETH balance.
* Instead of passing the provided value in `sendTransaction`, pass `value: 0` since the fees are paid in WETH instead of the ETH sent along with the transaction.

```javascript
import qs from 'qs';

(async () => {
    // selling 1 WETH for DAI
    const params = {
        buyToken: 'DAI',
        sellToken: 'WETH',
        sellAmount: '1000000000000000000',
        takerAddress: '0xAb5801a7D398351b8bE11C439e05C5B3259aeC9B', // vitalik's address
    }

    const response = await fetch(
        `https://api.0x.org/swap/v0/quote?${qs.stringify(params)}`
    );

    const quote = await response.json();
    
    if (response.ok) {
        await window.web3.eth.sendTransaction({
            ...quote,
            ...{
                value: 0,
            }
        });
    } else {
        // handle the error
    }
})();
```
