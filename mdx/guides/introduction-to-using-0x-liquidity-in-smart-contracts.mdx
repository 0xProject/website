# Introduction to Using 0x Liquidity In Smart Contracts

0x Protocol's networked liquidity can extend the capabilities of your DeFi project. This guide highlights some general concepts to help you start tapping into 0x's networked liquidity from within your smart contract.


## What can I do with 0x liquidity?

The ability for smart contracts to programmatically swap tokens (also known as [Contract Fillable Liquidity](https://blog.0xproject.com/contract-fillable-liquidity-made-simple-8b9cf1b2f2f2)) opens up a new world of opportunities for DeFi projects, such as:

* Seamlessly swap between ETH ↔ DAI ↔ MKR, allowing users to effectively interact with CDPs (Collateral Debt Positions) with ETH instead of DAI and MKR
* Use your margin trading protocol to offer users deep liquidity pools with competitive slippages
* Abstract away transaction fees
* Easily rebalance portfolios with atomic token swaps

In addition, [0x API](/docs/api) offers an easy-to-use interface for accessing the best prices for token swaps. By combining both and integrating competitively priced token swaps into smart contracts, DeFi projects can leverage network liquidity to create powerful new user experiences.


## Core concepts

### Orders: A unit of liquidity

**Orders **represent a single unit of liquidity on 0x Protocol. An order is a promise to swap a certain token for another token at a specified rate. The 0x Protocol specifies a [standard order format](../core-concepts#the-0x-order-message-format) that formalizes this promise. For a number of large asset pairs (i.e ETH/DAI, ETH/USDC), professional market makers produce a constant stream of orders, thus providing a consistent source of liquidity at competitive rates.

### Networked Liquidity: sharing orders with the world

An order involves two parties: a maker, who creates and signs the order; and a taker, who fills the order. For takers to find the best prices, they need to have access to the most possible orders. 0x Mesh is a P2P protocol that functions as a decentralized global network for sharing orders, including orders from Kyber, Uniswap, Oasis, and more. This results in a massive pool of “networked liquidity”. Unlike the fragmented nature of traditional centralized financial exchanges, networked liquidity guarantees takers are getting the best price available.

### 0x API: A one-step interface to networked liquidity

Any user can interact directly with the 0x Mesh network. However, the lower-level nature of the P2P protocol has a steeper learning curve to fully leverage it. 0x API offers a high-level interface to consume networked liquidity from 0x Mesh and other DEX aggregators. A simple HTTP request allows potential takers to obtain available orders (quotes) for the best prices on the network for swapping their desired tokens.

### Fill 0x orders from your smart contract

After obtaining satisfactory quotes for all necessary token swaps, your smart contract needs to execute the swap by interacting with 0x Protocol smart contracts. These are the core “libraries” that other smart contracts use to fill orders.  In the following guides, we will show exactly how to implement order filling within your smart contract.

## Building with 0x liquidity in smart contracts

Now that you are familiar with the core concepts of consuming liquidity from a smart contract, let's get started building!
