## Why does the value of the `to` field in the /swap/quote response vary?

0x API selects the best 0x protocol interface to interact with based on the provided parameters and the smart order routing logic. 

There are two main interfaces that 0x API will provide quotes for:

[**Exchange contract**](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-protocol-specification/blob/master/v3/v3-specification.md#exchange) - the main entry-point of the 0x protocol, all swap quotes are settled by the exchange contract.

[**Forwarder extension contract**](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-protocol-specification/blob/master/v3/forwarder-specification.md) - a payable interface allowing swaps between native ETH (as a `sellToken`) and another ERC20 asset.

Find the currently deployed contracts [here](https://0x.org/docs/guides/0x-cheat-sheet).


## How does the 0x API decide between the Forwarder and the Exchange?

The current 0x API logic for selecting between forwarder or exchange is deterministic and enable developers to easily ensure which interface is used for a quote:

* If `sellToken` is not set to `ETH` (say `WETH`), 0x API will always provide a quote that interfaces with the main exchange contract.
* If `sellToken` is set to `ETH`, 0x API will always provide a quote that interfaces with forwarder contract.

**TLDR** `sellToken=ETH` uses Forwarder, `sellToken=WETH` uses Exchange.

## Are the smart contracts audited?

Yes, 0x protocol’s contracts are open source and extensively tested by 0x core team’s internal protocol team and by external auditors (Consensys dilligence, Trail of Bits).

The [**Exchange**](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-protocol-specification/blob/master/v3/v3-specification.md#exchange) contract, because they are the main entry point of the 0x protocol, is versioned, and governed by ZRX token holders. Because of its critical place in 0x infrastructure, the 0x core team employs a number of external audits to ensure the safe and intended usage of the 0x contract.

The [**Forwarder**](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-protocol-specification/blob/master/v3/forwarder-specification.md) contract is internally audited and constantly improved upon by the 0x core team. Forwarder, an optional extension contract that users can opt in/out of using when swapping, has a minimized attack surface because no approval of user funds is needed.

## What is the difference between `price` and `guaranteedPrice`?

The `price` field provides developers a sense of what the BEST price they could receive, denominated in `sellToken` for one `buyToken`. The `gauranteedPrice` is the price that developers can expect in a WORST case scenario where all the fallback orders are utilized over the better priced orders.

Say you found a swap for ETH to DAI at 220 DAI while the market price for ETH is 200 DAI. Obviously this is a great price and will not last forever, a “race” of sorts occurs as users compete to settle the swap of ETH for 220 DAI by selecting a competitive gasPrice that would result in their transaction being mined over others. 

When such a race happens, only one user gets to receive the swap of ETH for 220 DAI, the other users will see their transactions revert. 

To ensure that users will always have their swap executed within a reasonable price, 0x API quoting logic provides a set of fallback orders, created with on-chain sources (kyber, uniswap, PLP, curve) that will be filled at a slightly worse rate if the more aggressively priced orders expires or are filled by somebody else.

**TLDR** expect the actual settled price of a 0x quote to be somewhere between `price` and `gauranteedPrice`.

## What is `slippagePercentage`?

Developers can influence how much “worse” the `guaranteedPrice` is through the `slippagePercentage` parameter. With on-chain sources, prices can vary between the quote being made and settlement. The `slippagePercentage` provides a "upper bound" to how much the price provided by these on-chain sources can slip and remain desirable by the developer.

**TLDR** `slippagePercentage` controls how much worse the price can be for the fallback orders provided in a 0x API quote which influences the `guaranteedPrice`.

## What are the differences when quoting by `sellAmount` and `buyAmount`?


* If `sellToken` is utilized, then any unused `sellToken` will be refunded to the user.
* When `buyAmount` is used, the only guarantee is that **at least** the amount specified is bought. 0xAPI will not terminate early in the case where one order fills at a better price, so the user can in effect over buy the specified amount. This is somewhat amplified by usage of `slippagePercentage` which underestimates the on-chain price by a percentage.


Also, some liquidity sources do not enable querying by `buyAmount` (i.e Kyber), these sources are ignored when quoting for `buyAmounts`

**TLDR** Whenever possible, use `sellAmount` over `buyAmount` to get more deterministic behavior.

## How does 0x API select the best orders for me?

Beyond simply sampling each liquidity source for their respective prices, 0x API adjusts for the gas consumption of each liquidity source with the specified gas price (if none provided 0x API will use ethGasStation's `fast` amount of gwei) and any associated fees with the specific liquidity source. By sampling through varying compositions of liquidity sources, 0x API selects the best set of orders to give you the best price. 0x API also creates another set of fallback orders to ensure that the quote can be executed by users.

Ex: 0x API will adjust the price potentially received from Curve Finance by gas * gasPrice and its fees. Because of Curve Finance’s costly gas consumption, its nominal price may not be the best price when settled.

## What is the `protocolFee`? 

A protocol fee is paid by takers and ultimately rebated to market makers when their orders are filled. Protocol fees are calculated per order using the gas price multiplied by a constant (currently 150,000). 

0x API calculates the required protocol fees to be paid and returns this in the `value` field. Since we recommend using a high gas price, in the event where the taker fills at a lower gas price, the excess is returned. 

It is possible for the protocol fees to be paid in WETH rather than sent in the transaction as ETH. This can be achieved by the taker having a WETH balance and setting a WETH allowance to the Protocol fee collector address. This [address](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa26e80e7dea86279c6d778d702cc413e6cffa777) can be read on the Exchange contract: `Exchange.protocolFeeCollector`.

**TLDR** 0x API handles the heavy lifting related to protocol fees and provides a `value` field.

## Why does my 0x transaction revert?

Aw shucks, are 0x quotes reverting? There are a number of low hanging fruits to check for when attempting to execute a quote beyond the obvious revert issues related to eth transactions:

* Are allowances properly set for the user to trade the `sellToken`?
* Does the user have enough `sellToken` balance to execute the swap?
* Do users have enough ETH or WETH to pay the `protocolFee`?

## How does `takerAddress` help with catching issues?

By passing a `takerAddress` parameter, 0x API can provide a more bespoke quote and help catch revert issues:

* 0x API will estimate the gas cost for `takerAddress` to execute the provided quote.
* If successfully called, the `gas` parameter in the quote will be an accurate amount of gas needed to execute the swap.
* If unsuccessful for revert reasons suggested above, then 0x API will throw a gas cost estimation error, alluding to an issue with the `takerAddress` executing the quote.

**TLDR** Pass `takerAddress` to get the quote validated before provided to you, assuring that a number of revert cases will not occur.

## 0x orders are reverting but my transaction is fine, what is happening?

Developers may note when analyzing their transactions that some subset of 0x orders may revert (not filled) but the whole transaction is successful. This is expected behavior as implied earlier, some orders due to timing, and the pricing may be filled or expired before a users attempt to fill the order. This would result in a revert and 0x protocol will utilize fallback orders to compensate for the reverted order. This will result in a successful transaction even though reverts occur within the transactions.

## How does gas price influence my transaction?

It is important to set a higher gas price as a default rather than to set it low and rely on the user to increase this in their wallet. The gas price directly influences the 0x Protocol fee paid to market makers. The 0x API calculates this protocol fee for you (and returns it in the `value` field) based on the supplied `gasPrice` (defaulted to `fast`). But if a gas price of 1 gwei was supplied and the user changes this to any higher amount, the transaction will fail as the `value` has not been updated to reflect the new gas price for the protocol fee.

It is best to understand your users and what gas price they typically fill at, if the user lowers their gas price the additional funds are returned.

Finding the best quote is also influenced by how expensive it is to fill a particular source. As an example, Kyber and Curve are relatively expensive steps in a route to fill as they consume a large amount of gas. When this is multiplied by the gas price some routes, although offer a better price on paper, result in a greater cost to the user. 0x API routes based on the `gasPrice` parameter provided, or defaults to a `fast` amount of gwei. When changing the gas price parameter from 1 to 8 gwei one can observe the change in routing.

**TLDR** Inform users to NOT increase the gas price beyond the quoted amount as the transaction will fail.

From our data, this is one of the largest reasons of why 0x quotes revert,** do your part in lowering the revert rates**!

## What is the return of executing the provided `calldata`? fillResults?

0x protocol returns a `FillResults` object that returns the result of executing a 0x swap:

```
struct FillResults {
    uint256 makerAssetFilledAmount;  // Total amount of buyToken filled.
    uint256 takerAssetFilledAmount;  // Total amount of sellToken filled.
    uint256 protocolFeePaid;         // Total amount of protocolFee pair in WETH or ETH
    ...
}
```


On-chain, easily decode the result of executing the `calldata` like so:

```
import "@0x/contracts-exchange-libs/contracts/src/LibFillResults.sol";

...

(bool success, bytes memory data) = address(exchange).call.value(quote.protocolFee)(quote.calldataHex);
require(success, "Swap not filled");
 fillResults = abi.decode(data, (LibFillResults.FillResults));
 
```
