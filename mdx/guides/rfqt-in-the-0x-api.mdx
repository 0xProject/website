# An Exclusive Source of Liquidity

In its role as a DEX aggregator, the 0x API integrates both on- and off-chain liquidity. On-chain liquidity is sourced by sampling smart contract liquidity pools, such as Uniswap and Curve. Off-chain liquidity has historically been sourced only by surveying open orderbooks on 0x Mesh.

With the use of RFQ-T, the 0x API aggregates not just on-chain pools and Mesh order books, but also real-time quotes from live market makers offering pricing available exclusively for trusted clients of the API.

RFQ is an abbreviation of Request for Quote, in that the 0x API requests quotes from market makers on behalf of its clients. The -T suffix indicates that the settlement transaction is to be submitted to the Ethereum network by the Taker. (An RFQ-M model, in which the maker submits the transaction, is under consideration, but is outside the scope of this Guide.)

# Limitations of Open Liquidity

Market makers providing open liquidity are subject to unique risks that impact their bottom-line pricing. If asset prices exhibit great movement in the markets, outstanding orders can flip from profitable to loss-incurring. And cancelling outstanding orders can be expensive and unreliable, subject to gas markets and front-running. Carrying these risks has a real cost, and that cost effectively deteriorates pricing for takers.

In practice, such losses are largely at the hands of one particular class of takers: arb bots. If makers share orders with an unspecified/null taker address, as is typical in Mesh order sharing, then those orders can be filled by anyone, including arb bots. Human traders, on the other hand, are extremely unlikely to be able to take advantage of such arbitrage opportunities. If market makers could somehow serve orders only to those human users, they could afford to offer better prices to them.

# Trusted Takers

The 0x API now automatically attempts to supplement every quote with RFQ-T liquidity. The biggest determinant of whether such live quotes will be aggregated with other liquidity sources is whether the client is a known and trusted taker.

Trusted takers are those that come to the 0x API through a trusted integration, typically a user-facing web application. The specific integration is identified to the 0x API by the presence of a `0x-api-key` HTTP header in its requests.

In addition to the API key, qualifying for access to RFQ-T also requires the presence of the otherwise optional [`takerAddress` query parameter](/docs/guides/0x-api-faq#how-does-takeraddress-help-with-catching-issues). This address will be encoded into the 0x order that gets hashed and signed by the maker to constitute their quote, enabling the 0x protocol to enforce the exclusivity of the offer.

The 0x API is configured with a list of API keys which are permitted to access RFQ-T liquidity. For the instance at `api.0x.org`, the 0x team is maintaining a list of trusted integrators, which at this time includes such projects as DeFi Saver and Zerion, and of course 0x's own Matcha.

# Dedicated Makers

In addition to the 0x API configuration identifying trusted takers, it also contains a list of specific market makers that participate in the RFQ-T model. Each maker is identified by an HTTP endpoint URL, and each endpoint has an associated list of asset pairs for which that endpoint will provide quotes.

For the instance at `api.0x.org`, the 0x team is maintaining a list of trusted market makers, which at this time includes 0x's own Periscope Trading, as well as a handful of other partners.

Whenever a trusted taker requests a quote for an asset pair that's served by a known maker endpoint, the 0x API will solicit that maker for a quote on behalf of the taker, and will consider that quote during its aggregation of various liquidity sources.

# Maintaining Trust

RFQ-T market makers are never obligated to provide a quote. If they cannot provide a competitive price at a given moment, for example, they may decline to make an offer. Moreover, they may decline to respond for any reason at all.

Because the taker address is always known to the market maker, the maker can easily monitor taker behavior over time. Makers can potentially identify arbitrageurs, by identifying specific taker addresses that seem to repeatedly take advantage of the maker's mispriced orders. And because the maker has the option to choose whether or not to respond to the quote request, they can easily blacklist taker addresses that they deem to be arbitrageurs.

Furthermore, the request sent from the 0x API to an RFQ-T market maker also includes the API key associated with the trusted integration client. In the same way that makers can blacklist taker addresses, they also have the option to blacklist specific applications that integrate with the 0x API.

In order to retain access to RFQ-T liquidity, it's important for clients of the 0x API to be good citizens of the marketplace. For end users of trusted integrations, being a good citizen means actually filling the orders they claim to intend to fill. And for trusted integrations, it means properly managing their users' intentions; more specifically, it means adhering to the flow of using indicative quotes by default, and firm quotes only when appropriate.

# Quote Types: Indicative vs Firm

In order to improve capital efficiency, the RFQ-T model introduces a new request/response flow: first request pricing, then request a fillable quote.

When a market maker provides a fillable quote, which can be settled by the taker's submitting it to the 0x protocol, the taker has an expectation that the swap will actually settle, that it won't revert due to a lack of available maker assets. To uphold this expectation, makers will refrain from using those same assets as the basis for any other quotes, until the quote's expiry.

However, if every price inquiry required the maker to reserve capital, they would quickly end up with all of their capital in reserve. They would then be unable to provide any other quotes until those outstanding quotes were either filled or expired.

To alleviate this potential capital inefficiency, the RFQ-T model introduces the distinction between "indicative pricing" and "firm quotes." In service of this distinction, the 0x API offers two different resources for the use of RFQ-T.

## Indicative Pricing

The indicative pricing resource is hosted at [`/swap/v1/price`](/docs/api#get-swapv1price) and responds with pricing information, but that response does not contain a full 0x order, so it does not constitute a legitimate transaction that can be submitted to the Ethereum network. Therefore, when a market maker services an indicative request they do not need to reserve any capital for it, leaving their capital available for other quotes to other clients.

## Firm Quotes

The firm quote resource is hosted at [`/swap/v1/quote`](/docs/api#get-swapv1quote) and responds with a full 0x order, which can be submitted to an Ethereum node by the client. Therefore it is expected that the maker has reserved the maker assets required to settle the trade, leaving the order unlikely to revert.

Note that while the [`/price`](/docs/api#get-swapv1price) resource is new and specific to RFQ-T, the [`/quote`](/docs/api#get-swapv1quote) resource is the same one already used to access non-RFQ-T liquidity through the API. In order to qualify for RFQ-T liquidity, the request must include the query parameter `intentOnFilling=true` (in addition to the aforementioned `0x-api-key` and non-null `takerAddress`).

## When to Request Firm Quotes

0x API clients should strictly adhere to a rule of using indicative pricing by default, and of only requesting firm quotes when the user is actually intent on filling. For example, a continuously updating price display on a web page should be fed by indicative pricing, and a trade confirmation display should be fed by firm quotes.

Breaking this rule could lead to a maker noticing a specific integration consistently locking up their capital but never following through on trades, and thereby could lead to the maker blacklisting that integration. Again, in order to retain access to RFQ-T liquidity, it's important for integrated applications to be good citizens of the marketplace.

# Maker Endpoint Interactions

When a 0x API client submits a request that qualifies for RFQ-T liquidity, the 0x API will, during the handling of that request, submit requests to market makers' endpoints, and integrate their responses into the response for its own client.

<Image src="/images/docs/rfqt-flow.png" align="center" alt="RFQ-T request-response flow" marginBottom="40px" />

Take note: the market maker endpoints are to be consumed only by the 0x API, on behalf of its clients. They are not to be consumed directly by clients themselves. Do not confuse the maker endpoint specification with the 0x API specification.

## Maker Endpoint Specification

A participating market maker must host an HTTP endpoint. In order to secure the API keys given in requests, the maker's endpoint is required to support HTTPS.

The endpoint must host two separate resources. To request indicative pricing for its client, the 0x API will request the endpoint's `/price` resource. To request a firm quote for its client, it will request the endpoint's `/quote` resource. The request schema is the same for both resources, but the response schemas differ.

For either `/price` or `/quote`, the endpoint may respond with a quote that satisfies only a portion of the requested asset amount. In this case, assuming that the quote's pricing is competitive, the 0x API will serve that quote to the taker alongside supplemental liquidity from other sources.

The endpoint's response time (latency) is important. In order to avoid excessive latency in responding to the 0x API's own client, the API will only await makers' responses for a certain period of time. At the time of this writing, that period is set to 600 milliseconds, but that number is subject to change as the ecosystem develops. Any responses received after that wait period has elapsed will not be considered in the liquidity aggregation process.

A maker choosing to decline to provide a quote must send an HTTP status code 204, with no body content, back to the 0x API. Failing to respond in a timely manner can force the API to wait for its full timeout period: if all other RFQ-T providers had already responded, this would impose unnecessary latency on the 0x API client.

For reference, 0x has provided a basic implementation of a quote server, which demonstrates how to handle the request and response schemas outlined below. [The code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/0xProject/quote-server), and [it's published to NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@0x/quote-server).

\*: Each request must specify _one_ of _either_ `sellAmountBaseUnits` _or_ `buyAmountBaseUnits`.

### Indicative Pricing Response

To offer an indicative pricing quote, a request to GET the endpoint's `/price` resource must yield an HTTP 200 status code with a JSON body with the following properties, which comprise a subset of [the fields that constitute a 0x order](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-protocol-specification/blob/master/v3/v3-specification.md#order-message-format).

| Property Name           | Property Value                                                                                                    | Required? |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `makerAssetData`        | Metadata identifying the asset being offered by the maker; must correspond to the request's `buyTokenAddress`     | yes       |
| `makerAssetAmount`      | The amount of `makerAsset` that the maker is willing to offer                                                     | yes       |
| `takerAssetData`        | Metadata identifying the asset being demanded from the taker; must correspond to the request's `sellTokenAddress` | yes       |
| `takerAssetAmount`      | The amount of the `takerAsset` that the maker will accept in exchange for its `makerAssetAmount` offer            | yes       |
| `expirationTimeSeconds` | The Unix time, in seconds, at which the quoted pricing will expire                                                | yes       |

### Firm Quote Response

To offer a firm quote, a request to GET the endpoint's `/quote` resource must yield an HTTP 200 status code with a JSON body with the following properties.

| Property Name | Property Value                                                                 | Required? |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| `signedOrder` | A [signed 0x order](/docs/api#signed-order) meeting the criteria defined below | yes       |

The 0x API will decline to relay from maker to taker any orders that do not meet the following criteria:

-   `takerAddress` matches what was sent in the request
-   `takerAssetAmount` equal to or less than the `takerAssetAmount` given in the request.
-   `expirationTimeSeconds` set to a Unix time greater than or equal to 90 seconds in the future. (This number is subject to change as the ecosystem develops.)
-   `feeRecipientAddress` set to `0x1000000000000000000000000000000000000011`, which will ensure that the fill is attributed to the 0x API.

Important note: A market maker should serve a unique order for each separate request, even if it is from the same `takerAddress`.

# Caveats

## Quote Validation

Whenever a 0x API client specifies a `takerAddress` in their [`/quote`](/docs/api#get-swapv1quote) request, the API will validate the quote before returning it to the client, avoiding a number of possible causes for transaction reverts. (For more details, see ["How does `takerAddress` help with catching issues?"](/docs/guides/0x-api-faq#how-does-takeraddress-help-with-catching-issues).)

However, given that a `takerAddress` is required in order to obtain RFQ-T liquidity, and given that this requirement subverts the optionality of the quote validation feature, the implementation of RFQ-T introduced a new query parameter to the `/quote` resource: `skipValidation`. When this parameter is set to `true`, quote validation will be skipped. While validating even RFQ-T quotes is a best-practice recommended default, skipping validation can be useful in certain circumstances, such as when experimenting with a new maker integration deployment.

### Smart Contract Integrations Beware

One particular circumstance in which it may be necessary to skip quote validation is that in which the `takerAddress` refers to a smart contract. In this case, the validation of the quote by the 0x API could fail due to a lack of asset balances in the contract's account. In order to avoid such a validation failure, simply avoid validation, by specifying `skipValidation=true` in the query string of your `/quote` request.

## Excluding Liquidity Sources

When requesting a quote from the 0x API, clients can choose to have the API exclude specific liquidity sources. (For more details, see [the API specification](/docs/api).)

At this time, RFQ-T liquidity is considered by the 0x API to be included within the `0x`/`Native` liquidity group. (In the API's interface, it's referred to as `0x`, but in the underlying routing logic it's referred to as `Native`.)

Therefore, if a 0x API client intends to access RFQ-T liquidity, it's important that they not exclude the `0x` liquidity source.

## Observing RFQ-T Liquidity

Knowing whether or not you have successfully accessed RFQ-T liquidity is at this time not straightforward.

One clue is whether the quote returned to the client indicates through its `sources` array that the liquidity is from `0x`. RFQ-T liquidity will only ever be part of the `0x` group.

However, just because a quote is 100% `0x`-sourced does not necessarily mean it includes RFQ-T liquidity. The key thing to observe is the `takerAddress`es in the `orders` portion of the response. If a `0x`-sourced order is from a Mesh orderbook, it will have a null (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`) `takerAddress`. If a `0x`-sourced order is from an RFQ-T quote provider, it will have a `takerAddress` that matches the `takerAddress` that was sent in the request to the 0x API.
